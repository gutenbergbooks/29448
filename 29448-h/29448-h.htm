<p>The little Med Ship came out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of overdrive and the stars
were strange and the Milky Way
seemed unfamiliar. Which, of
course, was because the Milky
Way and the local Cepheid marker-stars
were seen from an unaccustomed
angle and a not-yet-commonplace
pattern of varying
magnitudes. But Calhoun grunted
in satisfaction. There was a
banded sun off to port, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
good. A breakout at no more than
sixty light-hours from one's destination
wasn't bad, in a strange
sector of the Galaxy and after
three light-years of journeying
blind.</p>

<p>"Arise and shine, Murgatroyd,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
said Calhoun. "Comb
your whiskers. Get set to astonish
the natives!"</p>

<p>A sleepy, small, shrill voice
said;</p>

<p>"<i>Chee!</i>"</p>

<p>Murgatroyd the <i>tormal</i> came
crawling out of his small cubbyhole.
He blinked at Calhoun.</p>

<p>"We're due to land shortly,"
Calhoun observed. "You'll impress
the local inhabitants. I'll
be unpopular. According to the
records, there's been no Med Ship
inspection here for twelve standard
years. And that was practically
no inspection, to judge by
the report."</p>

<p>Murgatroyd said;</p>

<p>"<i>Chee-chee!</i>"</p>

<p>He began to make his toilet,
first licking his right-hand
whiskers and then his left. Then
he stood up and shook himself
and looked interestedly at Calhoun.
<i>Tormals</i> are companionable
small animals. They are
charmed when somebody speaks
to them. They find great, deep
satisfaction in imitating the actions
of humans, as parrots and
mynahs and parrokets imitate
human speech. But <i>tormals</i> have
certain useful, genetically transmitted
talents which make them
much more valuable than mere
companions or pets.</p>

<p>Calhoun got a light-reading
for the banded sun. It could
hardly be an accurate measure
of distance, but it was a guide.
He said;</p>

<p>"Hold on to something, Murgatroyd!"</p>

<p>Calhoun threw the overdrive
switch and the Med Ship flicked
back into that questionable state
of being in which velocities of
some hundreds of times that of
light are possible. The sensation
of going into overdrive was unpleasant.
A moment later, the
sensation of coming out was no
less so. Calhoun had experienced
it often enough, and still didn't
like it.</p>

<p>The sun Weald burned huge
and terrible in space. It was
close, now. Its disk covered half
a degree of arc.</p>

<p>"Very neat," observed Calhoun.
"Weald Three is our port,
Murgatroyd. The plane of the
ecliptic would be&mdash;Hm...."</p>

<p>He swung the outside electron
telescope, picked up a nearby
bright object, enlarged its image
to show details, and checked it
against the local star-pilot. He
calculated a moment. The distance
was too short for even the
briefest of overdrive hops, but
it would take time to get there
on solar-system drive.</p>

<p>He thumbed down the com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>municator-button
and spoke into
a microphone.</p>

<p>"Med Ship Aesclipus Twenty
reporting arrival and asking co√∂rdinates
for landing. Purpose
of landing, planetary health inspection.
Our mass is fifty tons
standard. We should arrive at a
landing position in something
under four hours. Repeat. Med
Ship Aesclipus Twenty ..."</p>

<p>He finished the regular second
transmission and made coffee
for himself while he waited for
an answer. Murgatroyd wanted
a cup of coffee too. Murgatroyd
adored coffee. He held a tiny cup
in a furry small paw and sipped
gingerly at the hot liquid.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>A voice came out of the communicator;</p>

<p>"<i>Aesclipus Twenty, repeat your
identification!</i>"</p>

<p>Calhoun went to the control-board.</p>

<p>"Aesclipus Twenty," he said
patiently, "is a Med Ship, sent
by the Interstellar Medical Service
to make a planetary health inspection
on Weald. Check with
your public health authorities.
This is the first Med Ship visit
in twelve standard years, I believe,
which is inexcusable. But
your health authorities will know
all about it. Check with them."</p>

<p>The voice said truculently;</p>

<p>"<i>What was your last port?</i>"</p>

<p>Calhoun named it. This was
not his home sector, but Sector
Twelve had gotten into a very
bad situation. Some of its planets
had gone unvisited for as long as
twenty years, and twelve between
inspections was almost common-place.
Other sectors had been
called on to help it catch up. Calhoun
was one of the loaned Med
Ship men, and because of the
emergency he'd been given a list
of half a dozen planets to be inspected
one after another, instead
of reporting back to sector
headquarters after each visit.
He'd had minor troubles before
with landing-grid operators in
Sector Twelve.</p>

<p>So he was very patient. He
named the planet last inspected,
the one from which he'd set out
for Weald Three. The voice from
the communicator said sharply;</p>

<p>"<i>What port before that?</i>"</p>

<p>Calhoun named the one before
the last.</p>

<p>"<i>Don't drive any closer,</i>" said
the voice harshly, "<i>or you'll be
destroyed!</i>"</p>

<p>Calhoun said coldly;</p>

<p>"Now you listen to me, friend!
I'm from the Interstellar Medical
Service! You get in touch
with planetary health services
immediately! Remind them of
the Interstellar Medical Inspection
Agreement, signed on Tralee
two hundred and forty standard
years ago. Remind them that if
they do not cooperate in medical
inspection that I can put your
planet under quarantine and your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
space commerce will be cut off
like that! No ship will be
cleared for Weald from any other
planet in the galaxy until there
has been a health inspection!
Things have pretty well gone to
pot so far as the Med Service in
this sector is concerned, but
we're trying to straighten it out.
You have twenty minutes to clear
this and then, I'm coming in. If
I'm not landed, a quarantine goes
on! Tell your health authorities
that!"</p>

<p>Silence. Calhoun clicked off
and poured himself another cup
of coffee. Murgatroyd held out
his cup for a refill. Calhoun gave
it to him.</p>

<p>"I hate to put on an official
hat, Murgatroyd," he said annoyedly,
"but there are some people
who won't have any other
way."</p>

<p>Murgatroyd said "<i>Chee!</i>" and
sipped at his cup.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>Calhoun checked the course of
the Med Ship. It bored on through
space. There were tiny noises
from the communicator. There
were whisperings and rustlings
and the occasional strange and
sometimes beautiful musical
notes whose origin is yet obscure,
but which, since they are
carried by electromagnetic radiation
of wildly varying wave-lengths,
are not likely to be the
fabled music of the spheres. He
waited.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>In fifteen minutes a different
voice came from the speaker.</p>

<p>"<i>Med Ship Aesclipus! Med
Ship Aesclipus!</i>"</p>

<p>Calhoun answered and the
voice said anxiously;</p>

<p>"<i>'Sorry about the challenge,
but we have the blueskin problem
always with us. We have to
be extremely careful! Will you
come in, please?</i>"</p>

<p>"I'm on my way," said Calhoun.</p>

<p>"<i>The planetary health authorities,</i>"
said the voice, more anxiously
still, "<i>are very anxious to
be co√∂perative. We need Med
Service help! We lose a lot of
sleep over the blueskins! Could
you tell us the name of the last
Med Ship to land here, and its
inspector, and when that inspection
was made? We want to look
up the record of the event to be
able to assist you in every possible
way.</i>"</p>

<p>"He's lying," Calhoun told
Murgatroyd, "but he's more
scared than hostile."</p>

<p>He picked up the order-folio on
Weald Three. He gave the information
about the last Med Ship
visit. He clicked off.</p>

<p>"What?" he asked, "is a blueskin?"</p>

<p>He'd read the folio on Weald,
of course, but as the ship swam
onward through emptiness he
went through it again. The last
medical inspection had been only
perfunctory. Twelve years earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>&mdash;instead
of three&mdash;a Med Ship
had landed on Weald. There had
been official conferences with
health officials. There was a report
on the birth-rate, the death-rate,
the anomaly-rate, and a
breakdown of all reported communicable
diseases. But that was
all. There were no special comments
and no overall picture.</p>

<p>Presently Calhoun found the
word in a Sector dictionary,
where words of only local usage
were to be found.</p>

<p>"Blueskin; Colloquial term for
a person recovered from a
plague which left large patches
of blue pigment irregularly
distributed over the body. Especially,
inhabitants of Dara.
The condition is said to be
caused by a chronic, non-fatal
form of Dara plague and has
been said to be non-infectious,
though this is not certain. The
etiology of Dara plague has
not fully been worked out. The
blueskin condition is hereditary
but not a genetic modification,
as markings appear in
non-Mendellian distributions...."</p>

<p>Calhoun puzzled over it. Nobody
could have read the entire
Sector directory, even with unlimited
leisure during travel between
solar systems. Calhoun
hadn't tried. But now he went
laboriously through indices and
cross-references while the ship
continued travel onward. He
found no other reference to blueskins.
He looked up Dara. It was
listed as an inhabited planet,
some four hundred years colonized,
with a landing-grid and at
the time the main notice was
written out, a flourishing interstellar
commerce. But there was
a memo, evidently added to the
entry in some change of editions.</p>

<p>"Since plague, special license
from Med Service is required for
landing."</p>

<p>That was all. Absolutely all.</p>

<p>The communicator said suavely;</p>

<p>"<i>Med Ship Aesclipus Twenty!
Come in on vision, please!</i>"</p>

<p>Calhoun went to the control-board
and threw on vision.</p>

<p>"Well, what now?" he demanded.</p>

<p>His screen lighted. A bland
face looked out at him.</p>

<p>"<i>We have&mdash;ah&mdash;verified your
statements,</i>" said the third voice
from Weald. "<i>Just one more item.
Are you alone in your ship?</i>"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Calhoun,
frowning.</p>

<p>"<i>Quite alone?</i>" insisted the
voice.</p>

<p>"Obviously!" said Calhoun.</p>

<p>"<i>No other living creature?</i>" insisted
the voice again.</p>

<p>"Of&mdash;Oh!" said Calhoun annoyedly.
He called over his shoulder.
"Murgatroyd! Come here!"</p>

<p>Murgatroyd hopped to his lap
and gazed interestedly at the
screen. The bland face changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
remarkably. The voice changed
even more.</p>

<p>"<i>Very good!</i>" it said. "<i>Very,
very good! Blueskins do not have</i>
tormals! <i>You are Med Service!
By all means come in. Your co√∂rdinates
will be ...</i>"</p>

<p>Calhoun wrote them down. He
clicked off the communicator
again and growled to Murgatroyd;</p>

<p>"So I might have been a blueskin,
eh? And you're my passport,
because only Med Ships
have members of your tribe
aboard! What the hell's the matter,
Murgatroyd? They act like
they think somebody's trying to
get down on their planet with a
load of plague-germs!"</p>

<p>He grumbled to himself for
minutes. The life of a Med Ship
man is not exactly a sinecure, at
best. It means long periods in
empty space in overdrive, which
is absolute and deadly tedium.
Then two or three days aground,
checking official documents and
statistics, and asking questions
to see how many of the newest
medical techniques have reached
this planet or that, and the supplying
of information about such
as have not arrived. Then lifting
out to space for long periods of
tedium, to repeat the process
somewhere else. Med Ships carry
only one man because two could
not stand the close contact without
quarreling with each other.
But Med Ships do carry <i>tormals</i>,
like Murgatroyd, and a <i>tormal</i>
and a man can get along indefinitely,
like a man and a dog. It
is a highly unequal friendship,
but it seems to be satisfactory
to both.</p>

<p>Calhoun was very much annoyed
with the way the Med
Service had been operated in
Sector Twelve. He was one of
many men at work to correct the
results of incompetence in directing
Med Service in the
twelfth sector. But it is always
disheartening to have to labor at
making up for somebody else's
blundering, when there is so
much new work that needs to be
done.</p>

<p>The condition shown by the
landing-grid suspicions was a
case in point. Blueskins were people
who inherited a splotchy skin-pigmentation
from other people
who'd survived a plague. Weald
plainly maintained a one-planet
quarantine against them. But a
quarantine is normally an emergency
measure. The Med Service
should have taken over, wiped
out the need for a quarantine, and
then lifted it. It hadn't been done.</p>

<p>Calhoun fumed to himself.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>The world of Weald Three
grew brighter and brighter
and became a disk. The disk had
ice-caps and a reasonable proportion
of land and water surface.
The Med Ship decelerated, and
voices notified observation from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the surface, and the little craft
came to a stop some five planetary
diameters out from solidity.
The landing-field force-field
locked on to it, and its descent
began.</p>

<p>The business of landing was
all very familiar, from the blue
rim which appeared at the limb
of the planet from one diameter
out, to the singular flowing-apart
of the surface features as the
ship sank still lower. There was
the circular landing-grid, rearing
skyward for nearly a mile. It
could let down interstellar liners
from emptiness and lift them out
to emptiness again, with great
convenience and economy for everyone.</p>

<p>It landed the Med Ship in its
center, and there were officials to
greet Calhoun, and he knew in
advance the routine part of his
visit. There would be an interview
with the planet's chief executive,
by whatever title he was
called. There would be a banquet.
Murgatroyd would be petted by
everybody. There would be painful
efforts to impress Calhoun
with the splendid conduct of public
health matters on Weald. He
would be told much scandal. He
might find one man, somewhere,
who passionately labored to advance
the welfare of his fellow
humans by finding out how to
keep them well, or failing that
how to make them well when they
got sick. And in two days, or
three, Calhoun would be escorted
back to the landing-grid, and
lifted out to space, and he'd spend
long empty days in overdrive
and land somewhere else to do
the whole thing all over again.</p>

<p>It all happened exactly as he
expected, with one exception.
Every human being he met on
Weald wanted to talk about blueskins.
Blueskins and the idea of
blueskins obsessed everyone. Calhoun
listened without asking
questions until he had the picture
of what blueskins meant to the
people who talked of them. Then
he knew there would be no use
asking questions at random. Nobody
mentioned ever having seen
a blueskin. Nobody mentioned a
specific event in which a blueskin
had at any named time taken
part. But everybody was afraid
of blueskins. It was a patterned,
an inculcated, a stage-directed
fixed idea. And it found expression
in shocked references to the
vileness, the depravity, the monstrousness
of the blueskin inhabitants
of Dara, from whom
Weald must at all costs be protected.</p>

<p>It did not make sense. So Calhoun
listened politely until he
found an undistinguished medical
man who wanted some special
information about gene-selection
as practised halfway across the
galaxy. He invited that man to
the Med Ship, where he supplied
the information not hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
available. He saw his guest's eyes
shine a little with that joyous
awe a man feels when he finds
out something he has wanted
long and badly to know.</p>

<p>"Now," said Calhoun, "tell me
something! Why does everybody
on this planet hate the inhabitants
of Dara? It's light-years
away. Nobody claims to have suffered
in person from them. Why
make a point of hating them?"</p>

<p>The Wealdian doctor grimaced.</p>

<p>"They've blue patches on their
skins. They're different from us.
So they can be pictured as a
danger and our political parties
can make an election issue out
of competing for the privilege of
defending us from them. They
had a plague on Dara, once.
They're accused of still having it
ready for export."</p>

<p>"Hm," said Calhoun. "The
story is that they want to spread
contagion here, eh? Doesn't anybody"&mdash;his
tone was sardonic&mdash;"doesn't
anybody urge that they
be massacred as an act of piety?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;s&mdash;s&mdash;s," admitted the doctor
reluctantly. "It's mentioned
in political speeches."</p>

<p>"But how's it rationalized?"
demanded Calhoun. "What's the
argument to make pigment-patches
involve moral and physical
degradation, as I'm assured
is the case?"</p>

<p>"In the public schools," said
the doctor, "the children are
taught that blueskins are now
carriers of the disease they survived
three generations ago!
That they hate everybody who
isn't a blueskin. That they are
constantly scheming to introduce
their plague here so most of us
will die and the rest become blueskins.
That's beyond rationalizing.
It can't be true, but it's not
safe to doubt it."</p>

<p>"Bad business," said Calhoun
coldly. "That sort of thing usually
costs lives, in the end. It
could lead to massacre!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it has, in a way,"
said the doctor unhappily. "One
doesn't like to think about it."
He paused, and said; "Twenty
years ago there was a famine on
Dara. There were crop-failures.
The situation must have been
very bad. They built a space-ship.
They've no use for such things
normally, because no nearby
planet will deal with them or let
them land. But they built a space-ship
and came here. They went
in orbit around Weald. They
asked to trade for shiploads of
food. They offered any price in
heavy metals, gold, platinum, iridium,
and so on. They talked
from orbit by vision communicators.
They could be seen to be
blueskins. You can guess what
happened!"</p>

<p>"Tell me," said Calhoun.</p>

<p>"We armed ships in a hurry,"
admitted the doctor, "We
chased their space-ship back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Dara. We hung in space off the
planet. We told them we'd blast
their world from pole to pole if
they ever dared take to space
again. We made them destroy
their one ship, and we watched
on visionscreens as it was done."</p>

<p>"But you gave them food?"</p>

<p>"No," said the doctor ashamedly.
"They were blueskins."</p>

<p>"How bad was the famine?"</p>

<p>"Who knows? Any number
may have starved! And we kept a
squadron of armed ships in their
skies for years. To keep them
from spreading the plague, we
said. And some of us believed it,
probably!"</p>

<p>The doctor's tone was purest
irony.</p>

<p>"Lately," he said, "there's been
a move for economy in our government.
Simultaneously, we began
to have a series of over-abundant
crops. The government
had to buy the excess grain to
keep the price up. Retired patrol-ships&mdash;built
to watch over
Dara&mdash;were available for storage-space.
We filled them up with
grain and sent them out into orbit.
They're there now, hundreds
of thousands or millions of tons
of grain!"</p>

<p>"And Dara?"</p>

<p>The Doctor shrugged. He stood
up.</p>

<p>"Our hatred of Dara," he said,
again ironically, "has produced
one thing. Roughly halfway between
here and Dara there's a
two-planet solar system, Orede.
There's a usable planet there. It
was proposed to build an outpost
of Weald there, against blueskins.
Cattle were landed to run wild
and multiply and make a reason
for colonists to settle there. They
did, but nobody wants to move
nearer to blueskins! So Orede
stayed uninhabited until a hunting-party
shooting wild cattle
found an outcropping of heavy-metal ore.
So now there's a mine
there. And that's all. A few hundred
men work the mine at fabulous
wages. You may be asked
to check on their health. But not
Dara's!"</p>

<p>"I see," said Calhoun, frowning.</p>

<p>The doctor moved toward the
Med Ship's exit-port.</p>

<p>"I answered your questions,"
he said grimly. "But if I talked
to anyone else as I've done to you,
I'd be lucky only to be driven into
exile!"</p>

<p>"I shan't give you away," said
Calhoun. He did not smile.</p>

<p>When the doctor had gone, Calhoun
said deliberately;</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd, you should be
grateful that you're a <i>tormal</i> and
not a man. There's nothing about
being a <i>tormal</i> to make you
ashamed!"</p>

<p>Then he grimly changed his
garments for the full-dress uniform
of the Med Service. There
was to be a banquet at which he
would sit next to the planet's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
chief executive and hear innumerable
speeches about the splendor
of Weald. Calhoun had his
own, strictly Med Service opinion
of the planet's latest and most
boasted-of achievement. It was a
domed city in the polar regions,
where nobody ever had to go outdoors.
He was less than professionally
enthusiastic about the
moving streets, and much less approving
of the dream-broadcasts
which supplied hypnotic, sleep-inducing
rhythms to anybody
who chose to listen to them. The
price was that while asleep one
would hear high praise of commercial
products, and one might
believe them when awake.</p>

<p>But it was not Calhoun's function
to criticize when it could be
avoided. Med Service had been
badly managed in Sector Twelve.
So at the banquet Calhoun made
a brief and diplomatic address in
which he temperately praised
what could be praised, and did
not mention anything else.</p>

<p>The chief executive followed
him. As head of the government
he paid some tribute to the Med
Service. But then he reminded
his hearers proudly of the high
culture, splendid health, and remarkable
prosperity of the planet
since his political party took office.
This, he said, was in spite
of the need to be perpetually on
guard against the greatest and
most immediate danger to which
any world in all the galaxy was
exposed. He referred to the blueskins,
of course. He did not need
to tell the people of Weald what
vigilance, what constant watchfulness
was necessary against
that race of depraved and malevolent
deviants from the norm of
humanity. But Weald, he said
with emotion, held aloft the torch
of all that humanity held most
dear, and defended not alone the
lives of its people against blueskin
contagion, but their noble
heritage of ideals against Blueskin
pollution.</p>

<p>When he sat down, Calhoun
said very politely;</p>

<p>"It looks like some day it
should be practical politics to
urge the massacre of all blueskins.
Have you thought of
that?"</p>

<p>The chief executive said comfortably;</p>

<p>"The idea's been proposed. It's
good politics to urge it, but it
would be foolish to carry it out.
People vote against blueskins.
Wipe them out, and where'd you
be?"</p>

<p>Calhoun ground his teeth,
quietly.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>There were more speeches.
Then a messenger, white-faced,
arrived with a written
note for the chief executive. He
read it and passed it to Calhoun.
It was from the Ministry of
Health. The space-port reported
that a ship had just broken out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
from overdrive within the Wealdian
solar system. Its tape-transmitter
had automatically signalled
its arrival from the mining-planet
Orede. But, having
sent off its automatic signal, the
ship lay dead in space. It did not
drive toward Weald. It did not
respond to signals. It drifted like
a derelict upon no course at all.
It seemed ominous, and since it
came from Orede&mdash;the planet
nearest to Dara of the blueskins&mdash;the
health ministry informed
the planet's chief executive.</p>

<p>"It'll be blueskins," said that
astute person, firmly. "They're
next-door to Orede. That's who's
done this. It wouldn't surprise
me if they'd seeded Orede with
their plague, and this ship came
from there to give us warning!"</p>

<p>"There's no evidence for anything
of the sort," protested Calhoun.
"A ship simply came out of
overdrive and didn't signal further.
That's all."</p>

<p>"We'll see," said the chief executive
ominously. "We'll go directly
to the spaceport."</p>

<p>Calhoun retrieved Murgatroyd
who had been visiting with the
wives of the higher-up officials.
His small paunch distended with
cakes and coffee and such delicacies
as he'd been plied with.
He was half comatose from over-feeding
and over-petting, but he
was glad to see Calhoun. At the
spaceport they discovered the situation
remained unchanged.</p>

<p>A ship from Orede had come
out of overdrive and lay dead in
emptiness. It did not answer
calls. It did not move in space.
It floated eerily in no orbit around
anything, going nowhere; doing
nothing. And panic was the consequence.</p>

<p>It seemed to Calhoun that the
official handling of the matter accounted
for the terror that he
could feel building up. The so-far-unexplained
bit of news was
on the air all over the planet
Weald. There was nobody awake
of all the world's population who
did not believe that there was a
new danger in the sky. Nobody
doubted that it came from blueskins.
The treatment of the news
was precisely calculated to keep
alive the hatred of Weald for the
inhabitants of the world Dara.</p>

<p>Calhoun put Murgatroyd into
the Med Ship and went back to
the spaceport office. A small
space-boat, designed to inspect
the circling grain-ships from
time, was already aloft. The
landing-grid had thrust it swiftly
out most of the way. Now it
droned and drove on sturdily toward
the enigmatic ship.</p>

<p>Calhoun took no part in the
agitated conferences among the
officials and news reporters at the
space-port. But he listened to the
talk about him. As the investigating
small ship drew nearer
and nearer to the deathly-still
cargo vessel, the guesses about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the meaning of its breakout and
following silence grew more and
more wild. But, singularly, there
was not one suggestion that the
mystery might not be the work
of blueskins. Blueskins were
scapegoats for all the fears and
all the uneasiness a perhaps over-civilized
world developed.</p>

<p>Presently the investigating
space-boat reached the mystery
ship and circled it, beaming queries.
No answer. It reported the
cargo-ship dark. No lights shone
anywhere on or in it. There were
no induction-surges from even
pulsing, idling engines. Delicately,
the messenger-craft maneuvered
until it touched the silent
vessel. It reported that microphones
detected no motion whatever
inside.</p>

<p>"Let a volunteer go aboard,"
commanded the chief executive.
"Have him report what he finds."</p>

<p>A pause. Then the solemn announcement
of an intrepid volunteer's
name, from far, far away.
Calhoun listened, frowning darkly.
This pompous heroism wouldn't
be noticed in the Med Service.
It would be routine behavior.</p>

<p>Suspenseful, second-by-second
reports. The volunteer had rocketed
himself across the emptiness
between the two again-separated
ships. He had opened the airlock
from outside. He'd gone in. He'd
closed the outer airlock door.
He'd opened the inner. He reported.</p>

<p>The relayed report was almost
incoherent, what with horror and
incredulity and the feeling of
doom that came upon the volunteer.
The ship was a bulk-cargo
ore-carrier, designed to run between
Orede and Weald with cargoes
of heavy-metal ores and a
crew of no more than five men.
There was no cargo in her holds
now, though. Instead, there were
men. They packed the ship. They
filled the corridors. They had
crawled into every cargo and other
space where a man could find
room to push himself. There were
hundreds of them. It was insanity.
And it had been greater insanity
still for the ship to have
taken off with so preposterous a
load of living creatures.</p>

<p>But they weren't living any
longer. The air apparatus had
been designed for a crew of five.
It could purify the air for possibly
twenty or more. But there
were hundreds of men in hiding
as well as in plain view in the
cargo-ship from Orede. There
were many, many times more
than her air apparatus and reserve
tanks could possibly have
serviced. They couldn't even have
been fed during the journey from
Orede to Weald!</p>

<p>But they hadn't starved. Air-scarcity
killed them before the
ship came out of overdrive.</p>

<p>A remarkable thing was that
there was no written message in
the ship's log which referred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
its take-off. There was no memorandum
of the taking on of such
an impossible number of passengers.</p>

<p>"The blueskins did it," said the
chief executive of Weald. He was
pale. All about Calhoun men
looked sick and shocked and terrified.
"It was the blueskins!
We'll have to teach them a lesson!"
Then he turned to Calhoun.
"The volunteer who went on
that ship ... He'll have to stay
there, won't he? He can't be
brought back to Weald without
bringing contagion ..."</p>

<p>Calhoun raged at him.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">CHAPTER 2</h2>


<p>There was a certain coldness
in the manner of those at the
Weald spaceport when the Med
Ship left next morning. Calhoun
was not popular because Weald
was scared. It had been conditioned
to scare easily, where
blueskins might be involved. Its
children were trained to react
explosively when the word "blueskin"
was uttered in their hearing,
and its adults tended to say
"blueskin" when anything to
cause uneasiness entered their
minds. So a planet-wide habit of
non-rational response had formed
and was not seen to be irrational
because almost everybody had it.</p>

<p>The volunteer who'd discovered
the tragedy on the ship from
Orede was safe, though. He'd
made a completely conscientious
survey of the ship he'd volunteered
to enter and examine. For
his courage, he'd have been
doomed but for Calhoun. The reaction
of his fellow-citizens was
that by entering the ship he
might have become contaminated
by blueskin infective material if
the plague still existed, and if
the men in the ship had caught it&mdash;but
they certainly hadn't died
of it&mdash;and if there had been blueskins
on Orede to communicate it&mdash;for
which there was no evidence&mdash;and
if blueskins were responsible
for the tragedy. Which
was at the moment pure supposition.
But Weald feared he might
bring death back to Weald if he
were allowed to return.</p>

<p>Calhoun saved his life. He ordered
that the guard-ship admit
him to its airlock, which then
was to be filled with steam and
chlorine. The combination would
sterilize and partly even eat away
his space-suit, after which the
chlorine and steam should be bled
out to space, and air from the
ship let into the lock. If he
stripped off the space-suit without
touching its outer surface,
and re√´ntered the investigating
ship while the suit was flung outside
by a man in another space-suit,
handling it with a pole he'd
fling after it, there could be no
possible contamination brought
back.</p>

<p>Calhoun was quite right, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Weald in general considered that
he'd persuaded the government
to take an unreasonable risk.</p>

<p>There were other reasons for
disapproving of him. Calhoun
had been unpleasantly frank.
The coming of the death-ship
stirred to frenzy those people who
believed that all blueskins should
be exterminated as a pious act.
They'd appeared on every visionscreen,
citing not only the ship
from Orede but other incidents
which they interpreted as crimes
against Weald. They demanded
that all Wealdian atomic reactors
be modified to turn out fusion-bomb
materials while a space-fleet
was made ready for an anti-blueskin
crusade. They confidently
demanded such a rain of fusion-bombs
on Dara that no blueskin,
no animal, no shred of vegetation,
no fish in the deepest
ocean, not even a living virus-particle
of the blueskin plague could
remain alive on the blueskin
world!</p>

<p>One of these vehement orators
even asserted that Calhoun
agreed that no other course was
possible, speaking for the Interstellar
Medical Service. And Calhoun
furiously demanded a
chance to deny it by broadcast,
and he made a bitter and indiscreet
speech from which a planet-wide
audience inferred that he
thought them fools. He did.</p>

<p>So he was definitely unpopular
when his ship lifted from Weald.
He'd curtly given his destination
as Orede, from which the death-ship
had come. The landing-grid
locked on, raised the small space-craft
until Weald was a great
shining ball below it, and then
somehow scornfully cast him off.
The Med Ship was free, in clear
space where there was not enough
of a gravitational field to hinder
overdrive.</p>

<p>He aimed for his destination,
his face very grim. He said savagely;</p>

<p>"Get set, Murgatroyd! Overdrive
coming!"</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>He thumbed down the overdrive
button. The universe of
stars went out, while everything
living in the ship felt the customary
sensations of dizziness,
of nausea, and of a spiralling fall
to nothingness. Then there was
silence. The Med Ship actually
moved at a rate which was a preposterous
number of times the
speed of light, but it felt absolutely
solid, absolutely firm and
fixed. A ship in overdrive feels
exactly as if it were buried deep
in the core of a planet. There is
no vibration. There is no sign of
anything but solidity and&mdash;if one
looks out a port&mdash;there is only
utter blackness plus an absence
of sound fit to make one's eardrums
crack.</p>

<p>But within seconds random
tiny noises began. There was a
reel and there were sound-speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>ers
to keep the ship from sounding
like a grave. The reel played
and the speakers gave off minute
creakings, and meaningless
hums, and very tiny noises of every
imaginable sort, all of which
were just above the threshold of
the inaudible.</p>

<p>Calhoun fretted. Sector Twelve
was in very bad shape. A conscientious
Med Service man
would never have let the anti-blueskin
obsession go unmentioned
in a report on Weald.
Health is not only a physical affair.
There is mental health, also.
When mental health goes a civilization
can be destroyed more
surely and more terribly than by
any imaginable war or plague-germ.
A plague kills off those
who are susceptible to it, leaving
immunes to build up a world
again. But immunes are the first
to be killed when a mass neurosis
sweeps a population.</p>

<p>Weald was definitely a Med
Service problem world. Dara was
another. And when hundreds of
men jammed themselves into a
cargo-boat which could not furnish
them with air to breathe,
and took off and went into overdrive
before the air could fail....
Orede called for no less of
worry.</p>

<p>"I think," said Calhoun dourly,
"that I'll have some coffee."</p>

<p>"Coffee" was one of the words
that Murgatroyd recognized immediately.
He would usually
watch the coffee-maker with
bright, interested eyes. He'd even
tried to imitate Calhoun's motions
with it, once, and had
scorched his paws in the attempt.
This time he did not move.</p>

<p>Calhoun turned his head. Murgatroyd
sat on the floor, his long
tail coiled reflectively about a
chair-leg. He watched the door of
the Med Ship's sleeping-cabin.</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd," said Calhoun.
"I mentioned coffee!"</p>

<p>"<i>Chee!</i>" shrilled Murgatroyd.</p>

<p>But he continued to look at the
door. The temperature was kept
lower in the other cabin, and the
look of things was different from
the control-compartment. The
difference was part of the means
by which a man was able to be
alone for weeks on end&mdash;alone
save for his <i>tormal</i>&mdash;without becoming
ship-happy. There were
other carefully thought out items
in the ship with the same purpose.
But none of them should
cause Murgatroyd to stare fixedly
and fascinatedly at the sleeping-cabin
door. Not when coffee
was in the making!</p>

<p>Calhoun considered. He became
angry at the immediate suspicion
that occurred to him. As
a Med Service man, he was duty-bound
to be impartial. To be impartial
might mean not to side
absolutely with Weald in its enmity
to blueskins. The people of
Weald had refused to help Dara
in a time of famine; they'd block<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>aded
that pariah world for years
afterward; they had other reasons
for hating the people they'd
treated badly. It was entirely reasonable
for some fanatic on
Weald to consider that Calhoun
must be killed lest he be of help
to the blueskins Weald abhorred.</p>

<p>In fact, it was quite possible
that somebody had stowed away
on the Med Ship to murder Calhoun,
so that there would be no
danger of any report favorable
to Dara ever being presented
anywhere. If so, such a stowaway
would be in the sleeping-cabin
now, waiting for Calhoun to walk
unsuspiciously in to be shot dead.</p>

<p>So Calhoun made coffee. He
slipped a blaster into a pocket
where it would be handy. He filled
a small cup for Murgatroyd and
a large one for himself, and then
a second large one.</p>

<p>He tapped on the sleeping-cabin
door, standing aside lest a
blaster-bolt came through it.</p>

<p>"Coffee's ready," he said sardonically.
"Come out and join
us."</p>

<p>There was a long pause. Calhoun
rapped again.</p>

<p>"You've a seat at the captain's
table," he said more sardonically
still. "It's not polite to keep me
waiting!"</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>He listened, alert for a rush
which would be a fanatic's
desperate attempt to do murder
despite premature discovery. He
was prepared to shoot quite
ruthlessly.</p>

<p>But there was no rush. Instead,
there came hesitant foot-falls.
The door of the cabin slid
slowly aside. A girl appeared in
the opening, desperately white
and desperately composed.</p>

<p>"H-how did you know I was
there?" she asked shakily. She
moistened her lips. "You didn't
see me! I was in a closet, and you
didn't even enter the room!"</p>

<p>Calhoun said grimly;</p>

<p>"I've sources of information."
He pointed to Murgatroyd.</p>

<p>The girl did not move. Her
eyes went from Murgatroyd to
Calhoun.</p>

<p>"And now," said Calhoun, "do
you want to tell me your story?
You have one ready, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"There&mdash;there isn't any," said
the girl unsteadily. "Just&mdash;I&mdash;I
need to get to Orede, and you're
going there. There's no other
way to go&mdash;now."</p>

<p>"To the contrary," said Calhoun,
"there'll undoubtedly be a
fleet heading for Orede as soon
as it can be assembled and armed.
But I'm afraid that's not a very
good story. Try another."</p>

<p>She shivered a little.</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;running away ..."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Calhoun. "In that
case I'll take you back."</p>

<p>"No!" she said fiercely. "I'll&mdash;I'll
die first! I'll wreck this ship
first!"</p>

<p>Her hand came from behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
her. There was a tiny blaster in
it. But it shook visibly as she
tried to aim it.</p>

<p>"I'll&mdash;shoot out the controls!"</p>

<p>Calhoun blinked. He'd had to
make a drastic change in his estimate
of the situation the instant
he saw that the stowaway
was a girl. Now he had to make
another when her threat was not
to kill him but to disable the
ship. Women are rarely assassins,
and when they are they don't use
energy weapons. Daggers and
poisons are more typical.</p>

<p>"I'd rather you didn't do that,"
said Calhoun drily. "Besides,
you'd get deadly bored if we were
stuck in a derelict waiting for
our air and food to give out."</p>

<p>Murgatroyd, for no reason
whatever, felt it necessary to enter
the conversation. He said;</p>

<p>"<i>Chee-chee-chee!</i>"</p>

<p>"A very sensible suggestion,"
observed Calhoun. "We'll sit down
and have a cup of coffee." To the
girl he said, "I'll take you to
Orede, since that's where you say
you want to go."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;there's a boy there&mdash;"</p>

<p>Calhoun shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he said reprovingly.
"Nearly all the mining colony
had packed itself into the ship
that came into Weald with everybody
dead. But not all. And
there's been no check of what
men were in the ship and what
men weren't. You wouldn't go to
Orede if it were likely your fellow
had died on the way to you.
Here's your coffee. Sugar or saccho,
and do you take cream?"</p>

<p>She trembled a little, but she
took the cup.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't understand&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd and I," explained
Calhoun&mdash;and he did not know
whether he spoke out of anger
or something else&mdash;"we are do-gooders.
We go around trying to
keep people from getting killed.
It's our profession. We practise
it even on our own behalf. We
want to stay alive. So since you
make such drastic threats, we
will take you where you want to
go. Especially since we're going
there anyhow."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;don't believe anything
I've said!" It was a statement.</p>

<p>"Not a word," admitted Calhoun.
"But you'll probably tell us
something more believable presently.
When did you eat last?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Better have something now.
We'll talk more later." Calhoun
showed her how to punch the
readier for such-and-such dishes,
to be extracted from storage and
warmed or chilled, as the case
might be, and served at dialed-for
intervals.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>Calhoun deliberately immersed
himself in the Galactic
Directory, looking up the planet
Orede. He was headed there,
but he'd had no reason to inform
himself about it before. Now he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
read with every appearance of
absorption.</p>

<p>The girl ate daintily. Murgatroyd
watched with highly amiable
interest. But she looked acutely
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Calhoun finished with the Directory.
He got out the microfilm
reels which contained more
information. He was specifically
after the Med Service history of
all the planets in this sector. He
went through the filmed record
of every inspection ever made on
Weald and on Dara. But Sector
Twelve had not been well-run.
There was no adequate account of
a plague which had wiped out
three-quarters of the population
of an inhabited planet! It had
happened shortly after one Med
Ship visit, and was over before
another Med Ship came by. But
there should have been painstaking
investigation, even after the
fact. There should have been a
collection of infective material
and a reasonably complete identification
and study of the infective
agent. It hadn't been made.
There was probably some other
emergency at the time, and it
slipped by. But Calhoun&mdash;whose
career was not to be spent in this
sector&mdash;resolved on a blistering
report about this negligence and
its consequences.</p>

<p>He kept himself casually busy,
ignoring the girl. A Med Ship
man has resources of study and
meditation with which to occupy
himself during overdrive travel
from one planet to another. Calhoun
made use of those resources.
He acted as if he were completely
unconscious of the stowaway.
But Murgatroyd watched her
with charmed attention.</p>

<p>Hours after her discovery, she
said uneasily;</p>

<p>"Please?"</p>

<p>Calhoun looked up.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't know exactly how
things stand."</p>

<p>"You are a stowaway," said
Calhoun. "Legally, I have the
right to put you out the airlock.
It doesn't seem necessary. There's
a cabin. When you're sleepy, use
it. Murgatroyd and I can make
out quite well here. When you're
hungry, you now know how to get
something to eat. When we land
on Orede, you'll probably go
about whatever business you
have there. That's all."</p>

<p>She stared at him.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;you don't believe what
I've told you!"</p>

<p>"No," agreed Calhoun. But he
didn't add to the statement.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I will tell you," she offered.
"The police were after me.
I had to get away from Weald! I
had to! I'd stolen&mdash;"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "If you were a
thief, you'd say anything in the
world except that you were a
thief. You're not ready to tell the
truth yet. You don't have to, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
why tell me anything? I suggest
that you get some sleep."</p>

<p>She rose slowly. Twice her
lips parted as if to speak again,
but then she went into the other
cabin and closed herself in.</p>

<p>Murgatroyd blinked at the
place where she'd disappeared
and then climbed up into Calhoun's
lap, with complete assurance
of welcome. He settled himself
and was silent for moments.
Then he said;</p>

<p>"<i>Chee!</i>"</p>

<p>"I believe you're right," said
Calhoun. "She doesn't belong on
Weald, or with the conditioning
she'd have had, there'd be only
one place she'd dread worse than
Orede, and that would be Dara.
But I doubt she'd be afraid to
land even on Dara."</p>

<p>Murgatroyd liked to be talked
to. He liked to pretend that he
carried on a conversation, like
humans.</p>

<p>"<i>Chee-chee!</i>" he said with conviction.</p>

<p>"Definitely," agreed Calhoun.
"She's not doing this for her
personal advantage. Whatever
she thinks she's doing, it's more
important to her than her own
life. Murgatroyd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Chee?</i>" said Murgatroyd in
an inquiring tone.</p>

<p>"There are wild cattle on
Orede," said Calhoun. "Herds
and herds of them. I have a suspicion
that somebody's been
shooting them. Lots of them. Do
you agree? Don't you think that
a lot of cattle have been slaughtered
on Orede lately?"</p>

<p>Murgatroyd yawned. He settled
himself still more comfortably
in Calhoun's lap.</p>

<p>"<i>Chee,</i>" he said drowsily.</p>

<p>He went to sleep, while Calhoun
continued the examination
of highly condensed information.
Presently he looked up the normal
rate of increase, with other
data, among herds of <i>bivis domesticus</i>
in a wild state, on
planets where they have no natural
enemies. It wasn't unheard-of
for a world to be stocked with
useful types of Terran fauna and
flora before it was attempted to
be colonized. Terran life-forms
could play the devil with alien
ecological systems, very much to
humanity's benefit. Familiar micro√∂rganisms
and a standard vegetation
added to the practicality
of human settlements on otherwise
alien worlds. But sometimes
the results were strange.</p>

<p>They weren't often so strange,
however, as to cause some hundreds
of men to pack themselves
frantically aboard a cargo-ship
which couldn't possibly sustain
them, so that every man must die
while the ship was in overdrive.</p>

<p>Still, by the time Calhoun
turned in on a spare pneumatic
mattress, he had calculated that
as few as a dozen head of cattle,
turned loose on a suitable planet,
would have increased to herds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
thousands or tens or even hundreds
of thousands in much less
time than had probably elapsed.</p>

<p>The Med Ship drove on in
seemingly absolute solidity, with
no sound from without, with no
sight to be seen outside, with no
evidence at all that it was not
buried deep in the heart of a
planet instead of flashing through
emptiness at a speed so great as
to have no meaning.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>Next ship-day the girl looked
oddly at Calhoun when she
appeared in the control-room.
"Shall I&mdash;have breakfast?" she
asked uncertainly.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>Silently, she operated the food-readier.
She ate. Calhoun gave
the impression that he would respond
politely when spoken to, but
that he was busy with activities
that kept him remote from stowaways.</p>

<p>About noon, ship-time, she
asked;</p>

<p>"When will we get to Orede?"</p>

<p>Calhoun told her absently, as
if he were thinking of something
else.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what do you think
happened there? I mean, to make
that tragedy in the ship?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Calhoun.
"But I disagree with the authorities
on Weald. I don't think it
was a planned atrocity of the
blueskins."</p>

<p>"Wh-what are blueskins?"</p>

<p>Calhoun turned around and
looked at her directly.</p>

<p>"When lying," he said mildly,
"you tell as much by what you
pretend isn't, as by what you
pretend is. You know what blueskins
are!"</p>

<p>"B&mdash;but what do you think
they are?" she asked.</p>

<p>"There used to be a human disease
called smallpox," said Calhoun.
"When people recovered
from it, they were usually
marked. Their skin had little
scar-pits here and there. At one
time, back on Earth, it was expected
that everybody would
catch smallpox sooner or later,
and a large percentage would die
of it. And it was so much a matter
of course that if they printed
a description of a criminal, they
never mentioned it if he were
pock-marked&mdash;scarred. It was no
distinction. But if he didn't have
the markings, they'd mention
that!" He paused. "Those pock-marks
weren't hereditary, but
otherwise a blueskin is like a
man who had them. He can't be
anything else!"</p>

<p>"Then you think they're&mdash;human?"</p>

<p>"There's never yet been a case
of reverse evolution," said Calhoun.
"Maybe pithecanthropus
had a monkey uncle, but no pithecanthropus
ever went monkey."</p>

<p>She turned abruptly away. But
she glanced at him often during
that day. He continued to busy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
himself with those activities
which make a Med Ship man's
life consistent with retained sanity.</p>

<p>Next day she asked without
preliminary;</p>

<p>"Don't you believe the blueskins
planned for the ship with
the dead men to arrive at Weald
and spread plague there?"</p>

<p>"No," said Calhoun.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"It couldn't possibly work,"
Calhoun told her. "With only
dead men on board, the ship
wouldn't arrive at a place where
the landing-grid could bring it
down. So that would be no good.
And plague-stricken living men
wouldn't try to conceal that they
had the plague. They might ask
for help, but they'd know they'd
instantly be killed on Weald if
they were found to be plague-victims.
So that would be no
good, either! No, the ship wasn't
intended to land plague on
Weald."</p>

<p>"Are you&mdash;friendly to blueskins?"
she asked uncertainly.</p>

<p>"Within reason," said Calhoun,
"I am a well-wisher to all
the human race. You're slipping,
though. When using the word
'blueskin' you should say it uncomfortably,
as if it were a word
no refined person liked to pronounce.
You don't. We'll land on
Orede tomorrow, by the way. If
you ever intend to tell me the
truth, there's not much time."</p>

<p>She bit her lips. Twice, during
the remainder of the day, she
faced him and opened her mouth
as if to speak, and then turned
away again. Calhoun shrugged.
He had fairly definite ideas about
her, by now. He carefully kept
them tentative, but no girl born
and raised on Weald would willingly
go to Orede, with all of
Weald believing that a shipload
of miners preferred death to remaining
there. It tied in, like
everything else that was unpleasant,
to blueskins. Nobody from
Weald would dream of landing
on Orede! Not now!</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>A little before the Med Ship
was due to break out from
overdrive, the girl said very carefully;</p>

<p>"You've been&mdash;very kind. I'd
like to thank you. I&mdash;didn't really
believe I would&mdash;live to get to
Orede."</p>

<p>Calhoun raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;wish I could tell you everything
you want to know," she
added regretfully. "I think you're&mdash;really
decent. But some things...."</p>

<p>Calhoun said caustically;</p>

<p>"You've told me a great deal.
You weren't born on Weald. You
weren't raised there. The people
of Dara&mdash;notice that I don't say
blueskins, though they are&mdash;the
people of Dara have made at least
one space-ship since Weald
threatened them with extermina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>tion.
There is probably a new
food-shortage on Dara now, leading
to pure desperation. Most
likely it's bad enough to make
them risk landing on Orede to
kill cattle and freeze beef to
help. They've worked out."</p>

<p>She gasped and sprang to her
feet. She snatched out the tiny
blaster in her pocket. She pointed
it waveringly at him.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;have to kill you!" she
cried desperately. "I&mdash;I have to!"</p>

<p>Calhoun reached out. She
tugged despairingly at the blaster's
trigger. Nothing happened.
Before she could realize that she
hadn't turned off the safety, Calhoun
twisted the weapon from her
fingers. He stepped back.</p>

<p>"Good girl!" he said approvingly.
"I'll give this back to you
when we land. And thanks.
Thanks very much!"</p>

<p>She stared at him. "Thanks?
When I tried to kill you?"</p>

<p>"Of course!" said Calhoun.
"I'd made guesses. I couldn't
know that they were right. When
you tried to kill me, you confirmed
every one. Now, when we
land on Orede I'm going to get
you to try to put me in touch
with your friends. It's going to
be tricky, because they must be
pretty well scared about that
ship. But it's a highly desirable
thing to get done!"</p>

<p>He went to the ship's control-board
and sat down before it.</p>

<p>"Twenty minutes to break-hour,"
he observed.</p>

<p>Murgatroyd peered out of his
little cubbyhole. His eyes were
anxious. <i>Tormals</i> are amiable little
creatures. During the days in
overdrive, Calhoun had paid less
than the usual amount of attention
to Murgatroyd, while the
girl was fascinating. They'd made
friends, awkwardly on the girl's
part, very pleasantly on Murgatroyd's.
But only moments ago
there had been bitter emotion in
the air. Murgatroyd had fled to
his cubbyhole to escape it. He
was distressed. Now that there
was silence again, he peered out
unhappily.</p>

<p>"<i>Chee?</i>" he queried plaintively.
"<i>Chee-chee-chee?</i>"</p>

<p>Calhoun said matter-of-factly;</p>

<p>"It's all right, Murgatroyd. If
we aren't blasted as we try to
land, we should be able to make
friends with everybody and get
something accomplished."</p>

<p>The statement was hopelessly
inaccurate.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">CHAPTER 3</h2>


<p>There was no answer from
the ground when breakout
came and Calhoun drove the Med
Ship to a favorable position for a
call. He patiently repeated, over
and over again, that Med
Ship Aesclipus Twenty notified
its arrival and requested co√∂rdi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>nates
for landing. There should
have been a crisp description of
the direction from the planet's
center at which, a certain time so
many hours or minutes later, the
force-fields of the grid would find
it convenient to lock onto and
lower the Med Ship. But the communicator
remained silent.</p>

<p>"There is a landing-grid," said
Calhoun, frowning, "and if they're
using it to load fresh meat for
Dara, from the herds I'm told
about, it should be manned. But
they don't seem to intend to answer.
Maybe they think that if
they pretend I'm not here I'll go
away."</p>

<p>He reflected, and his frown
deepened.</p>

<p>"If I didn't know what I do
know, I might. So if I land on
emergency-rockets the blueskins
down below may decide that I
come from Weald. And in that
case it would be reasonable to
blast me before I could land and
unload some fighting men. On the
other hand, no ship from Weald
would conceivably land without
impassioned assurance that it
was safe. It would drop bombs."
He turned to the girl. "How many
Darians down below?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"You don't know," said Calhoun,
"or won't tell, yet. But they
ought to be told about the arrival
of that ship at Weald, and what
Weald thinks about it! My guess
is that you came to tell them. It
isn't likely that Dara gets news
direct from Weald. Where were
you put ashore from Dara, when
you set out to be a spy?"</p>

<p>Her lips parted to speak. But
she compressed them tightly. She
shook her head again.</p>

<p>"It must have been plenty far
away," said Calhoun restlessly.
"Your people would have built a
ship, and made fine forged papers
for it, and they'd travel so
far from this part of space that
when they landed nobody would
think of Dara. They'd use makeup
to cover the blue spots, but
maybe it was so far away that
blueskins had never been heard
of!"</p>

<p>Her face looked pinched, but
she did not reply.</p>

<p>"Then they'd land half a dozen
of you, with a supply of makeup
for the blue patches. And you'd
separate, and take ships that
went various roundabout ways,
and arrive on Weald one by one,
to see what could be done there to...."
He stopped. "When did you
find out positively that there
wasn't any plague any more?"</p>

<p>She began to grow pale.</p>

<p>"I'm not a mind-reader," said
Calhoun. "But it adds up. You're
from Dara. You've been on
Weald. It's practically certain
that there are other, agents, if
you like that word better, on
Weald. And there hasn't been a
plague on Weald so you people
aren't carriers of it. But you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
knew it in advance, I think.
How'd you learn? Did a ship in
some sort of trouble land there,
on Dara?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes," said the girl. "We
wouldn't let it go again. But the
people didn't catch&mdash;they didn't
die&mdash;they lived&mdash;."</p>

<p>She stopped short.</p>

<p>"It's not fair to trap me!" she
cried passionately, "It's not
fair!"</p>

<p>"I'll stop," said Calhoun.</p>

<p>He turned to the control-board.
The Med Ship was only planetary
diameters from Orede, now,
and the electron telescope showed
shining stars in leisurely motion
across its screen. Then a huge,
gibbous shining shape appeared,
and there were irregular patches
of that muddy color which is sea-bottom,
and varicolored areas
which were plains and forests.
Also there were mountains. Calhoun
steadied the image and
squinted at it.</p>

<p>"The mine," he observed, "was
found by members of a hunting-party,
killing wild cattle for
sport."</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>Even a small planet has many
millions of square miles of
surface, and a single human installation
on a whole world will
not be easy to find by random
search. But there were clues to
this one. Men hunting for sport
would not choose a tropic nor an
arctic climate to hunt in. So if
they found a mineral deposit, it
would have been in a temperate
zone. Cattle would not be found
deep in a mountainous terrain.
The mine would not be on a prairie.
The settlement on Orede,
then, would be near the edge of
mountains, not far from a prairie
such as wild cattle would frequent,
and it would be in a temperate
climate. Forested areas
could be ruled out. And there
would be a landing-grid. Handling
only one ship at a time, it
might be a very small grid. It
need be only hundreds of yards
across and less than half a mile
high. But its shadow would be
distinctive.</p>

<p>Calhoun searched among low
mountains near unforested prairie
in a temperate zone. He found
a speck. He enlarged it many-fold,
and it was the mine on Orede.
There were heaps of tailings.
There was something which cast
a long, lacy shadow. The landing-grid.</p>

<p>"But they don't answer our
call," observed Calhoun, "so we
go down unwelcomed."</p>

<p>He inverted the Med Ship and
the emergency-rockets boomed.
The ship plunged planetward.</p>

<p>A long time later it was deep
in the planet's atmosphere. The
noise of its rockets had become
thunderous, with air to carry and
to reinforce the sound.</p>

<p>"Hold on to something, Murgatroyd,"
commanded Calhoun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
"We may have to dodge some
ack."</p>

<p>But nothing came up from below.
The Med Ship again inverted
itself, and its rockets pointed
toward the planet and poured out
pencil-thin, blue-white, high-velocity
flames. It checked slightly,
but continued to descend. It was
not directly above the grid. It
swept downward until almost
level with the peaks of the mountains
in which the mine lay. It
tilted again, and swept onward
over the mountain-tops, and then
tilted once more and went racing
up the valley in which the landing-grid
was plainly visible. Calhoun
swung it on an erratic
course, lest there be opposition.</p>

<p>But there was no sign. Then
the rockets bellowed, and the ship
slowed its forward motion, hovered
momentarily, and settled to
solidity outside the framework
of the grid. The grid was small,
as Calhoun reasoned. But it
reached interminably toward the
sky.</p>

<p>The rocket cut off. Slender as
the flame had been, they'd melted
and bored thin drill-holes deep
into the soil. Molten rock boiled
and bubbled down below. But
there seemed no other sound.
There was no other motion. There
was absolute stillness all around.
But when Calhoun switched on
the outside microphones a faint,
sweet melange of high-pitched
chirpings came from tiny creatures
hidden under the vegetation
of the mountainsides.</p>

<p>Calhoun put a blaster in his
pocket and stood up.</p>

<p>"We'll see what it looks like
outside," he said with a certain
grimness. "I don't quite believe
what the visionscreens show."</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>Minutes later he stepped
down to the ground from
the Med Ship's exit-port. The
ship had landed perhaps a hundred
feet from what once had
been a wooden building. In it, ore
from the mines was concentrated
and the useless tailings carried
away by a conveyor-belt to make
a monstrous pile of broken stone.
But there was no longer a building.
Next to it there had been a
structure containing an ore-crusher.
The massive machinery
could still be seen, but the structure
was fragments. Next to
that, again, had been the shaft-head
shelters of the mine. They
also were shattered practically to
match-sticks.</p>

<p>The look of the ground about
the building-sites was simply
and purely impossible. It was a
mass of hoofprints. Cattle by
thousands and tens of thousands
had trampled everything. Cattle
had burst in the wooden sides of
the buildings. Cattle had piled
themselves up against the beams
upholding roofs until the buildings
collapsed. Then cattle had
gone plunging over the wrecked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
buildings until there was nothing
left but indescribable chaos.
Many, many cattle had died in
the crush. There were heaps of
dead beasts about the metal girders
which were the foundation
of the landing-grid. The air was
tainted by the smell of carrion.</p>

<p>The settlement had been destroyed,
positively, by stampeded
cattle in tens or hundreds of
thousands charging blindly
through and over and upon it.
Senselessly, they'd trampled each
other to horrible shapelessnesses.
The mine-shaft was not choked,
because enormously strong timbers
had fallen across and blocked
it. But everything else was pure
destruction.</p>

<p>Calhoun said evenly;</p>

<p>"Clever! Very clever! You can't
blame men when beasts stampede!
We should accept the evidence
that some monstrous herd,
making its way through a mountain
pass, somehow went crazy
and bolted for the plains and this
settlement got in the way and it
was too bad for the settlement.
Everything's explained, except
the ship that went to Weald. A
cattle stampede, yes. Anybody
can believe that! But there was
a man-stampede! Men stampeded
into the ship as blindly as the cattle
trampled down this little
town. The ship stampeded off into
space as insanely as the cattle.
But a stampede of men <i>and</i>
cattle, in the same place,&mdash;that's
a little too much at one time!"</p>

<p>"How," asked Calhoun directly,
"do you intend to get in touch
with your friends here?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know," she said
distressedly. "But if&mdash;the ship
stays here, they're bound to come
and see why. Won't they? Or will
they?"</p>

<p>"If they're sane, they won't,"
said Calhoun. "The one undesirable
thing, here, would be human
footprints on top of cattle-tracks.
If your friends are a meat-getting
party from Dara, as I believe,
they should cover up their
tracks, get off-planet as fast as
possible, and pray that no signs
of their former presence are ever
discovered. That would be their
best first move, certainly!"</p>

<p>"What should I do?" she
asked helplessly.</p>

<p>"I'm far from sure. At a guess,
and for the moment, probably
nothing. I'll work something out ... I've
got the devil of a job before
me, though. I can't spend
too much time here."</p>

<p>"You can&mdash;leave me here...."</p>

<p>He grunted and turned away.
It was naturally unthinkable
that he should leave another human
being on a supposedly uninhabited
planet, with the knowledge
that it might actually be uninhabited,
and the further knowledge
that any visitors would have
the strongest of possible reasons
to hide themselves away.</p>

<p>He believed that there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Darians here, and the girl in the
Med ship&mdash;so he also believed&mdash;was
a Darian. But any who might
be hiding had so much to lose if
they were discovered that they
might be hundreds or even thousands
of miles from anywhere a
space-ship would normally land&mdash;if
they hadn't fled after the incident
of the space-ship's departure
with its load of doomed passengers.</p>

<p>Considered detachedly, the
odds were that there was again a
food-shortage on Dara. That
blueskins, in desperation, had
raided or were raiding or would
raid the cattle-herds of Orede for
food to carry back to their home
planet. That somehow the miners
on Orede had found that they had
blueskin neighbors, and died of
the consequences of their terror.
It was a risky guess to make on
such evidence as Calhoun considered
he had, but no other guess
was possible.</p>

<p>If his guess was right, he was
under some obligation to do exactly
what he believed the girl
considered her mission, to warn
all blueskins that Weald would
presently try to find them on
Orede, when all hell must break
loose upon Dara for punishment.
But if there were men here, he
couldn't leave a written warning
for them in default of friendly
contact. They might not find it,
and a search-party of Wealdians
might. All he could possibly do
was try to make contact and give
warning by such means as would
leave no evidence behind that he'd
done so. Weald would consider a
warning sure proof of blueskin
guilt.</p>

<p>It was not satisfactory to be
limited to broadcasts which
might not be picked up, and were
unlikely to be acknowledged. But
he settled down with the communicator
to make the attempt.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>He called first on a GC wave-length
and form. It was unlikely
that blueskins would use
general-communication bands to
keep in touch with each other,
but it had to be tried. He broadcast,
as broadly tuned as possible,
and went up and down the
GC spectrum, repeating his warning
painstakingly and listening
without hope for a reply. He did
find one spot on the dial where
there was re-radiation of his message,
as if from a tuned receiver.
But he could not get a fix on it,
and nobody might be listening.
He exhausted the normal communication
pattern. Then he
broadcast on old-fashioned amplitude
modulation which a modern
communicator would not pick
up at all, and which therefore
might be used by men in hiding.</p>

<p>He worked for a long time.
Then he shrugged and gave it up.
He'd repeated to absolute tedium
the facts that any Darians&mdash;blueskins&mdash;on
Orede ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
know. There'd been no answer.
And it was all too likely that if
he'd been received, that those
who heard him took his message
for a trick to discover if there
were any hearers.</p>

<p>He clicked off at last and stood
up, shaking his head. Suddenly
the Med Ship seemed empty.
Then he saw Murgatroyd staring
at the exit-port. The inner
door of that small airlock was
closed. The tell-tale said the outer
was not locked. Someone had
gone out, quietly. The girl. Of
course. Calhoun said angrily;</p>

<p>"How long ago, Murgatroyd?"</p>

<p>"<i>Chee!</i>" said Murgatroyd indignantly.</p>

<p>It wasn't an answer, but it
showed that Murgatroyd was
vexed that he'd been left behind.
He and the girl were close friends,
now. If she'd left Murgatroyd in
the ship when he wanted to go
with her, she wasn't coming
back.</p>

<p>Calhoun swore. Then he made
certain. She was not in the ship.
He flipped the outside-speaker
switch and said curtly into the
microphone;</p>

<p>"Coffee! Murgatroyd and I
are having coffee. Will you come
back, please?"</p>

<p>He repeated the call, and repeated
it again. Multiplied as his
voice was by the speakers, she
should hear him within a mile.
She did not appear. He went to
a small and inconspicuous closet
and armed himself. A Med Ship
man was not ever expected to
fight, but there were blast-rifles
available for extreme emergency.</p>

<p>When he'd slung a power-pack
over his shoulder and reached the
airlock, there was still no sign of
his late stowaway. He stood in
the airlock door for long minutes,
staring angrily about. Almost
certainly she wouldn't be looking
in the mountains for men of Dara
come here for cattle. He used a
pair of binoculars, first at low-magnification
to search as wide
an area down-valley as possible,
and then at highest power to
search the most likely routes.</p>

<p>He found a small, bobbing
speck beyond a far-away hillcrest.
It was her head. It went
down below the hilltop.</p>

<p>He snapped a command to
Murgatroyd, and when the <i>tormal</i>
was on the ground outside,
he locked the port with that combination
that nobody but a Med
Ship man was at all likely to discover
or use.</p>

<p>"She's an idiot!" he told Murgatroyd
sourly. "Come along!
We've got to be idiots too!"</p>

<p>He set out in pursuit.</p>

<p>The girl had a long start.
Twice Calhoun came to places
where she could have chosen either
of two ways onward. Each
time he had to determine which
she'd followed. That cost time.
Then the mountains ended,
abruptly, and a vast undulating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
plain stretched away to the horizon.
There were at least two large
masses and many smaller clumps
of what could only be animals
gathered together. Cattle.</p>

<p>But here the girl was plainly
in view. Calhoun increased his
stride. He began to gain on her.
She did not look behind.</p>

<p>Murgatroyd said "<i>Chee!</i>" in a
complaining tone.</p>

<p>"I should have left you behind,"
agreed Calhoun dourly,
"but there was and is a chance
I won't get back. You'll have to
keep on hiking."</p>

<p>He plodded on. His memory of
the terrain around the mining
settlement told him that there
was no definite destination in the
girl's mind. But she was in no
such despair as to want deliberately
to be lost. She'd guessed,
Calhoun believed, that if there
were Darians on the planet,
they'd keep the landing-grid under
observation. If they saw her
leave that area and could see that
she was alone, they should intercept
her to find out the meaning
of the Med Ship's landing. Then
she could identify herself as one
of them and give them the terribly
necessary warning of Weald's
suspicions.</p>

<p>"But," said Calhoun sourly,
"if she's right, they'll have seen
me marching after her now,
which spoils her scheme. And I'd
like to help it, but the way she's
going is too dangerous!"</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>He went down into one of the
hollows of the uneven plain.
He saw a clump of a dozen or so
cattle a little distance away. The
bull looked up and snorted. The
cows regarded him truculently.
Their air was not one of bovine
tranquility.</p>

<p>He was up the farther hillside
and out of sight before the bull
worked himself up to a charge.
Then Calhoun suddenly remembered
one of the items in the data
about cattle he'd looked into just
the other day. He felt himself
grow pale.</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd!" he said sharply.
"We've got to catch up! Fast!
Stay with me if you can, but ..."
He was jog-trotting as he
spoke&mdash;"even if you get lost I
have to hurry!"</p>

<p>He ran fifty paces and walked
fifty paces. He ran fifty and
walked fifty. He saw her, atop a
rolling of the ground. She came
to a full stop. He ran. He saw
her turn to retrace her steps. He
flung to the safety of the blast-rifle
and let off a roaring blast at
the ground for her to hear.</p>

<p>Suddenly she was fleeing desperately,
toward him. He plunged
on. She vanished down into a
hollow. Horns appeared over the
hillcrest she'd just left. Cattle
appeared. Four&mdash;a dozen&mdash;fifteen&mdash;twenty.
They moved ominously
in her wake. He saw her again,
running frantically over another
upward swell of the prairie. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
let off another blast to guide her.
He ran on at top speed with Murgatroyd
trailing anxiously behind.
From time to time Murgatroyd
called "<i>Chee-chee-chee!</i>"
in frightened pleading not to be
abandoned.</p>

<p>More cattle appeared against
the horizon. Fifty or a hundred.
They came after the first clump.
The first-seen group of a bull and
his harem were moving faster,
now. The girl fled from them, but
it is the instinct of beef-cattle
on the open range&mdash;Calhoun had
learned it only two days before&mdash;to
charge any human they find on
foot. A mounted man to their dim
minds is a creature to be tolerated
or fled from, but a human
on foot is to be crushed and
stamped and gored.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>Those in the lead were definitely
charging now, with heads bent
low. The bull charged furiously
with shut eyes, as bulls do, but
the many-times-more-deadly cows
charged with their eyes wide
open and wickedly alert, and with
a lumbering speed much greater
than the girl could manage.</p>

<p>She came up over the last rise,
chalky-white and gasping, her
hair flying, in the last extremity
of terror. The nearest of the pursuing
cattle were within ten
yards when Calhoun fired from
twenty yards beyond. One creature
bellowed as the blast-bolt
struck. It went down and others
crashed into it and swept over it,
and more came on. The girl saw
Calhoun, now, and ran toward
him, panting, and he knelt very
deliberately and began to check
the charge by shooting the leading
animals.</p>

<p>He did not succeed. There were
more cattle following the first,
and more and more behind them.
It appeared that all the cattle on
the plain joined in the blind and
senseless charge. The thudding
of hooves became a mutter and
then a rumble and then a growl.
Plunging, clumsy figures rushed
past on either side. But horns
and heads heaved up over the
mound of animals Calhoun had
shot. He shot them too. More and
more cattle came pounding past
the rampart of his victims, but
always, it seemed, some elected
to climb the heap of their dead
and dying fellows, and Calhoun
shot and shot.</p>

<p>But he split the herd. The foremost
animals had been charging a
sighted human enemy. Others
had followed because it is the instinct
of cattle to join their running
fellows in whatever crazed
urgency they feel. There was a
dense, pounding, horrible mass
of running bulls and cows and
calves; bellowing, wailing, grunting,
puffing, raising thick and
impenetrable clouds of dust which
had everything but galloping
beasts going past on either side.</p>

<p>It lasted for minutes. Then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
thunder of hooves diminished. It
ended abruptly, and Calhoun and
the girl were left alone with the
gruesome pile of animals which
had divided the charging herd into
two parts. They could see the
rears of innumerable running
animals, stupidly continuing the
charge&mdash;hardly different, now,
from a stampede&mdash;whose original
objective none now remembered.</p>

<p>Calhoun thoughtfully
touched the barrel of his
blast-rifle and winced at its
scorching heat.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>"I just realized," he said coldly,
"that I don't know your name.
What is it?"</p>

<p>"M-maril," said the girl. She
swallowed. "Th-thank you&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Maril," said Calhoun, "you
are an idiot! It was half-witted
at best to go off by yourself! You
could have been lost! You could
have cost me days of hunting for
you, days badly needed for more
important matters!" He stopped
and took breath. "You may have
spoiled what little chance I've got
to do something about the plans
Weald's already making!"</p>

<p>He said more bitterly still;</p>

<p>"And I had to leave Murgatroyd
behind to get to you in
time! He was right in the path
of that charge!"</p>

<p>He turned away from her and
said dourly;</p>

<p>"All right! Come on back to
the ship. We'll go to Dara. We'd
have to, anyhow. But Murgatroyd&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then he heard a very small
sneeze. Out of a rolling wall of
still-roiling dust, Murgatroyd appeared
forlornly. He was dust-covered,
and draggled, and his
tail drooped, and he sneezed
again. He moved as if he could
barely put one paw before another,
but at the sight of Calhoun he
sneezed yet again and said,
"<i>Chee!</i>" in a disconsolate voice.
Then he sat down and waited for
Calhoun to pick him up.</p>

<p>When Calhoun did so, Murgatroyd
clung to him pathetically
and said, "<i>Chee-chee!</i>" and
again "<i>Chee-chee!</i>" with the intonation
of one telling of incredible
horrors and disasters endured.</p>

<p>Calhoun headed back for the
valley, the settlement and the
Med Ship. Murgatroyd clung to
his neck. The girl Maril followed
visibly shaken.</p>

<p>Calhoun did not speak to her
again. He led the way. A mile
back toward the mountains, they
began to see stragglers from the
now-vanished herd. A little further,
those stragglers began to
notice them. And it would have
been a matter of no moment if
they'd been domesticated dairy-cattle,
but these were range-cattle
gone wild. Twice, Calhoun had
to use his blast-rifle to discourage
incipient charges by irritated
bulls or even more irritated cows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Those with calves darkly suspected
Calhoun of designs upon their
offspring.</p>

<p>It was a relief to enter the valley
again. But it was two miles
more to the landing-grid with the
Med Ship beside it and the reek
of carrion in the air.</p>

<p>They were perhaps two hundred
feet from the ship when a
blast-rifle crashed and its bolt
whined past Calhoun so close that
he felt the monstrous heat. There
had been no challenge. There was
no warning. There was simply a
shot which came horribly close
to ending Calhoun's career in a
completely arbitrary fashion.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">CHAPTER 4</h2>


<p>Five minutes later Calhoun
had located one would-be killer
behind a mass of splintered
planking that once had been a
wall. He set the wood afire by a
blaster-bolt and then viciously
sent other bolts all around the
man it had sheltered when he fled
from the flames. He could have
killed him ten times over, but it
was more desirable to open communication.
So he missed, intentionally.</p>

<p>Maril had cried out that she
came from Dara and had word
for them, but they did not answer.
There were three men with
heavy-duty blast-rifles. One was
the one Calhoun had burned out
of his hiding-place. That man's
rifle exploded when the flames hit
it. Two remained. One&mdash;so Calhoun
presently discovered&mdash;was
working his way behind underbrush
to a shelf from which he
could shoot down at Calhoun.
Calhoun had dropped into a hollow
and pulled Maril to cover at
the first shot. The second man
happily planned to get to a point
where he could shoot him like a
fish in a barrel. The third man
had fired half a dozen times and
then disappeared. Calhoun estimated
that he intended to get
around to the rear, in hope there
was no protection from that direction
for Calhoun. It would
take some time for him to manage
it.</p>

<p>So Calhoun industriously concentrated
his fire on the man trying
to get above him. He was behind
a boulder, not too dissimilar
to Calhoun's breastwork. Calhoun
set fire to the brush at the
point at which the other man
aimed. That, then, made his effort
useless. Then Calhoun sent
a dozen bolts at the other man's
rocky shield. It heated up. Steam
rose in a whitish mass and blew
directly away from Calhoun. He
saw that antagonist flee. He saw
him so clearly that he was positive
that there was a patch of
blue pigment on the right-hand
side of the back of his neck.</p>

<p>He grunted and swung to find
the third. That man moved
through thick undergrowth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Calhoun set it on fire in a neat
pattern of spreading flames. Evidently,
these men had had no
training in battle-tactics with
blast-rifles. The third man also
had to get away. He did. But
something from him arched
through the smoke. It fell to the
ground directly upwind from
Calhoun. White smoke puffed up
violently.</p>

<p>It was instinct that made Calhoun
react as he did. He jerked
the girl Maril to her feet and
rushed her toward the Med Ship.
Smoke from the flung bomb upwind
barely swirled around him
and missed Maril altogether.
Calhoun, though, got a whiff of
something strange, not scorched
or burning vegetation at all. He
ceased to breathe and plunged
onward. In clear air he emptied
his lungs and refilled them. They
were then halfway to the ship,
with Murgatroyd prancing on
ahead.</p>

<p>But then Calhoun's heart began
to pound furiously. His muscles
twitched and tense. He felt
extraordinary symptoms like an
extreme of agitation. Calhoun
was familiar enough with tear-gas,
used by police on some planets.
But this was different and
worse. Even as he helped and
urged Maril onward, he automatically
considered his sensations,
and had it. Panic gas! Police
did not use it because panic
is worse than rioting. Calhoun
felt all the physical symptoms of
fear and of gibbering terror. A
man whose mind yields to terror
experiences certain physical sensations,
wildly beating heart,
tensed and twitching muscles,
and a frantic impulse to convulsive
action. A man in whom those
physical sensations are induced
by other means will&mdash;ordinarily&mdash;find
his mind yielding to terror.</p>

<p>Calhoun couldn't combat his
feelings, but his clinical attitude
enabled him to act despite them.
The three from Weald reached
the base of the Med Ship. One of
their enemies had lost his rifle
and need not be counted. Another
had fled from flames and might
be ignored for some moments,
anyhow. But a blast-bolt struck
the ship's metal hull only feet
from Calhoun, and he whipped
around to the other side and let
loose a staccato of fire which
emptied the rifle of all its charges.</p>

<p>Then he opened the airlock
door, hating the fact that he
shook and trembled. He urged
the girl and Murgatroyd in.
He slammed the outer airlock
door just as another blaster-bolt
hit.</p>

<p>"They&mdash;they don't realize,"
said Maril desperately. "If they
only knew&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Talk to them, if you like,"
said Calhoun. His teeth chattered
and he raged, because the symp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>tom
was of terror he denied.</p>

<p>He pushed a button on the
control-board. He pointed to a
microphone. He got at an oxygen-bottle
and inhaled deeply.
Oxygen, obviously, should be an
antidote for panic, since the
symptoms of terror act to increase
the oxygenation of the
blood-stream and muscles, and to
make superhuman exertion possible
if necessary. Breathing
ninety-five per cent oxygen produced
the effect the terror-inspiring
gas strove for, so his heart
slowed nearly to normal and his
body relaxed. He held out his
hand and it did not tremble.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>He turned to Maril. She hadn't
spoken into the mike yet.</p>

<p>"They&mdash;may not be from
Dara!" she said shakily. "I just
thought! They could be somebody
else&mdash;maybe criminals who
planned to raid the mine for a
shipload of its ore ..."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Calhoun. "I
saw one of them clearly enough
to be sure. But they're skeptical
characters. I'm afraid there may
be more on the way here wherever
they keep themselves. Anyhow,
now we know some of them
are in hearing! I'll take advantage
of that and we'll go on."</p>

<p>He took the microphone. Instants
later his voice boomed in
the stillness outside the ship,
cutting through the thin shrill
of invisible small creatures.</p>

<p>"This is the Med Ship Aesclipus
Twenty," said Calhoun's
voice, amplified to a shout. "I left
Weald four days ago, one day
after the cargo-ship from here arrived
with everybody on board
dead. On Weald they don't know
how it happened, but they suspect
blueskins. Sooner or later
they'll search here. Get away!
Cover up your tracks! Hide all
signs that you've ever been
here! Get the hell away, fast!
One more warning! There's talk
of fusion-bombing Dara. They're
scared! If they find your traces,
they'll be more scared still! So
cover up your tracks and&mdash;get&mdash;away&mdash;from&mdash;here!"</p>

<p>The many-times-multiplied
voice rolled and echoed among
the hills. But it was very clear.
Where it could be heard it could
be understood, and it could be
heard for miles.</p>

<p>But there was no response to
it. Calhoun waited a reasonable
time. Then he shrugged and
seated himself at the control-board.</p>

<p>"It isn't easy," he observed,
"to persuade desperate men that
they've out-smarted themselves!
Hold hard, Murgatroyd!"</p>

<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>

</div>
<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>The rockets bellowed. Then
there was a tremendous noise to
end all noises, and the ship began
to climb. It sped up and up
and up. By the time it was out of
atmosphere it had velocity
enough to coast to clear space
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>and Calhoun cut the rockets altogether.
He busied himself with
those astrogational chores which
began with orienting oneself to
galactic directions after leaving
a planet which rotates at its own
individual speed. Then one computes
the overdrive course to
another planet, from the respective
co√∂rdinates of the world one
is leaving and the one one aims
for. Then,&mdash;in this case at any
rate&mdash;there was the very finicky
task of picking out a fourth-magnitude
star of whose planets
one was his destination. He aimed
for it with ultra-fine precision.</p>

<p>"Overdrive coming," he said
presently. "Hold on!"</p>

<p>Space reeled. There was nausea
and giddiness and a horrible
sensation of falling in a wildly
unlikely spiral. Then stillness,
and solidity, and the blackness
of the Pit outside the Med Ship.
The little craft was in overdrive
again.</p>

<p>After a long while, the girl
Maril said uneasily.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you plan
now&mdash;."</p>

<p>"I'm going to Dara," said Calhoun.
"On Orede I tried to get
the blueskins there to get going,
fast. Maybe I succeeded. I don't
know. But this thing's been mishandled!
Even if there's a famine,
people shouldn't do things
out of desperation!"</p>

<p>"I know now that I was&mdash;very
foolish&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Forget it," commanded Calhoun.
"I wasn't talking about
you. Here I run into a situation
that the Med Service should have
caught and cleaned up generations
ago! But it's not only a
Med Service obligation, it's a current
mess! Before I could begin
to get at the basic problem, those
idiots on Orede&mdash;. It'd happened
before I reached Weald! An emotional
explosion triggered by a
ship full of dead men that nobody
intended to kill."</p>

<p>Maril shook her head.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>"Those Darian characters,"
said Calhoun annoyedly,
"shouldn't have gone to Orede in
the first place. If they went there,
they should at least have stayed
on a continent where there were
no people from Weald digging a
mine and hunting cattle for sport
on their off days! They could be
spotted! I believe they were! And
again, if it had been a long way
from the mine installation, they
could probably have wiped out
the people who sighted them before
they could get back with the
news! But it looks like miners
saw men hunting, and got close
enough to see they were blueskins,
and then got back to the
mine with the news!"</p>

<p>She waited for him to explain.</p>

<p>"I know I'm guessing, but it
fits!" he said distastefully. "So
something had to be done. Either
the mining settlement had to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
wiped out or the story that blueskins
were on Orede had to be
discredited. The blueskins tried
for both. They used panic-gas
on a herd of cattle and it made
them crazy and they charged the
settlement like the four-footed
lunatics they are! And the blueskins
used panic-gas on the settlement
itself as the cattle went
through. It should have settled
the whole business nicely. After
it was over every man in the settlement
would believe he'd been
out of his head for a while, and
he'd have the crazy state of the
settlement to think about, and he
wouldn't be sure of what he'd
seen or heard beforehand. They
might try to verify the blueskin
story later, but they wouldn't believe
anything certainly! It
should have worked!"</p>

<p>Again she waited. So Calhoun
said very wrily indeed;</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, when the miners
panicked, they stampeded into
the ship. Also unfortunately,
panic-gas got into the ship with
them. So they stayed panicked
while the astrogator&mdash;in panic!&mdash;took
off and headed for Weald
and threw on the overdrive&mdash;which
would be set for Weald
anyhow&mdash;because that would be
the fastest way to run away from
whatever he imagined he feared.
But he and all the men on the
ship were still crazy with panic
from the gas they were re-breathing
until they died!"</p>

<p>Silence. After a long interval,
Maril asked;</p>

<p>"You don't think the&mdash;Darians
intended to kill?"</p>

<p>"I think they were stupid!"
said Calhoun angrily. "Somebody's
always urging the police
to use panic-gas in case of public
tumult. But it's too dangerous.
Nobody knows what one man
will do in a panic. Take a hundred
or two or three and panic
them all, and there's no limit to
their craziness! The whole thing
was handled wrong!"</p>

<p>"But you don't blame them?"</p>

<p>"For being stupid, yes," said
Calhoun fretfully. "But if I'd
been in their place, perhaps ..."</p>

<p>"Where were you born?" asked
Maril suddenly.</p>

<p>Calhoun jerked his head
around. He said;</p>

<p>"No! Not where you're guessing&mdash;or
hoping. Not on Dara.
Just because I act as if Darians
were human doesn't mean I have
to be one! I'm a Med Service
man, and I'm acting as I think I
should." His tone became exasperated.
"Dammit, I'm supposed
to deal with health situations, actual
and possible causes of human
deaths! And if Weald thinks
it finds proof that blueskins are
in space again and caused the
death of Wealdians it won't be
healthy! They're halfway set
anyhow to drop fusion-bombs on
Dara to wipe it out!"</p>

<p>Maril said fiercely;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"They might as well drop
bombs. It'll be quicker than starvation,
at least!"</p>

<p>Calhoun looked at her more
exasperatedly than before.</p>

<p>"It is a crop failure again?"
he demanded. When she nodded
he said bitterly; "Famine conditions
already?" When she nodded
again he said drearily; "And
of course famine is the great-grandfather
of health problems!
And that's right in my lap with
all the rest!"</p>

<p>He stood up. Then he sat down
again.</p>

<p>"I'm tired!" he said flatly.
"I'd like to get some sleep."</p>

<p>Maril understood. She picked
up a book and went into the other
cabin.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>Alone in the control compartment,
he tried to relax, but it
was not possible. He flung himself
into a comfortable chair and
considered the situation of the
people of the planet Dara. Those
people were marked by patches
of blue pigment as an inherited
consequence of a plague of three
generations past. Dara was a
planet of pariahs, excluded from
the human race by those who had
been conditioned to fear them.</p>

<p>And now there was famine on
Dara for the second time, and
they were of no mind to starve
quietly. There was food on the
planet Orede, monstrous herds of
cattle without owners. It was natural
enough for Darians to build
a ship or ships and try to bring
food back to its starving people.
But that desperately necessary
enterprise had now roused Weald
to a frenzy of apprehension.
Weald was if possible more hysterically
afraid of blueskins than
ever before, and even more implacably
the enemy of the starving
planet's population. Weald
itself throve and prospered. Ironically,
it had such an excess of
foodstuffs that it stored them in
unneeded space-ships in orbits
about itself. Hundreds of thousands
of tons of grain circled
Weald in sealed-tight hulks,
while the people of Dara starved
and only dared try to steal&mdash;it
could be called stealing&mdash;some of
the innumerable wild cattle of
Orede.</p>

<p>The blueskins on Orede could
not trust Calhoun, so they pretended
not to hear&mdash;or maybe
they didn't hear. They'd been
abandoned and betrayed by all of
humanity beyond their world.
They'd been threatened and oppressed
by guardships in orbit
about them, ready to shoot down
any space-craft they might send
aloft.</p>

<p>So Calhoun pondered ...</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>A long time later Calhoun
heard small sounds which were
not normal on a Med Ship in
overdrive. They were not part of
the random noises carefully gen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>erated
to keep the silence of the
ship endurable. Calhoun raised
his head. He listened sharply. No
sound could come from outside.</p>

<p>He knocked on the door of
the sleeping-cabin. The noises
stopped instantly.</p>

<p>"Come out," he commanded
through the door.</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;I'm all right," said
Maril's voice. But it was not
quite steady. She paused. "I was
just having a bad dream."</p>

<p>"I wish," said Calhoun, "that
you'd tell me the truth occasionally!
Come out, please!"</p>

<p>There were stirrings. After a
little the door opened and Maril
appeared. She looked as if she'd
been crying. She said quickly;</p>

<p>"I probably look queer, but it's
because I was asleep."</p>

<p>"To the contrary," said Calhoun,
fuming, "you've been lying
awake crying. I don't know
why. I've been out here wishing
I could sleep, because I'm frustrated.
But since you aren't
asleep maybe you can help me
with my job. I've figured some
things out. For some others I
need facts. How about it?"</p>

<p>She swallowed.</p>

<p>"I'll try."</p>

<p>"Coffee?" he asked.</p>

<p>Murgatroyd popped his head
out of his miniature sleeping-cabin.</p>

<p>"<i>Chee?</i>" he asked interestedly.</p>

<p>"Go back to sleep!" snapped
Calhoun.</p>

<p>He began to pace back and
forth.</p>

<p>"I need to know something
about the pigment patches," he
said jerkily. "Maybe it sounds
crazy to think of such things
now. First things first, you
know. But that is a first thing!
So long as Darians don't look like
the people of other worlds, they'll
be considered different. If they
look repulsive, they'll be thought
of as evil.... Tell me about
those patches. They're different-sized
and different-shaped and
they appear in different places.
You've none on your face or
hands, anyhow."</p>

<p>"I haven't any at all," said the
girl reservedly.</p>

<p>"I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not everybody," she said defensively.
"Nearly, yes. But not
all. Some people don't have them.
Some people are born with bluish
splotches on their skin, but they
fade out while they're children.
When they grow up they're just
like&mdash;the people of Weald or any
other world. And their children
never have them."</p>

<p>Calhoun stared.</p>

<p>"You couldn't possibly be
proved to be a Darian, then?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. Calhoun
remembered, and started the coffee-maker.</p>

<p>"When you left Dara," he
said, "You were carried a long,
long way, to some planet where
they'd practically never heard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Dara, and where the name meant
nothing. You could have settled
there, or anywhere else and forgotten
about Dara. But you didn't.
Why not, since you're not a
blueskin?"</p>

<p>"But I am!" she said fiercely.
"My parents, my brothers and
sisters, and Korvan&mdash;."</p>

<p>Then she bit her lip. Calhoun
took note but did not comment
on the name that she had mentioned.</p>

<p>"Then your parents had the
splotches fade, so you never had
them," he said absorbedly.
"Something like that happened
on Tralee, once! There's a virus&mdash;a
whole group of virus particles!
Normally we humans are
immune to them. One has to be
in terrifically bad physical condition
for them to take hold and
produce whatever effects they do.
But once they're established
they're passed on from mother to
child.... And when they die
out it's during childhood, too!"</p>

<p>He poured coffee for the two of
them. As usual, Murgatroyd
swung down to the floor and said
impatiently;</p>

<p>"<i>Chee! Chee! Chee!</i>"</p>

<p>Calhoun absently filled Murgatroyd's
tiny cup and handed it
to him.</p>

<p>"But this is marvellous!" he
said exuberantly. "The blue
patches appeared after the
plague, didn't they? After people
recovered&mdash;when they recovered?"</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>Maril stared at him. His
mind was filled with strictly
professional considerations.
He was not talking to her as a
person. She was purely a source
of information.</p>

<p>"So I'm told," said Maril reservedly.
"Are there any more
humiliating questions you want
to ask?"</p>

<p>He gaped at her. Then he said
ruefully;</p>

<p>"I'm stupid, Maril, but you're
touchy. There's nothing personal."</p>

<p>"There is to me!" she said
fiercely. "I was born among blueskins,
and they're of my blood,
and they're hated and I'd have
been killed on Weald if I'd been
known as&mdash;what I am! And
there's Korvan, who arranged for
me to be sent away as a spy and
advised me to do just what you
said,&mdash;abandon my home world
and everybody I care about! Including
him! It's personal to
me!"</p>

<p>Calhoun wrinkled his forehead
helplessly.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he repeated,
"Drink your coffee!"</p>

<p>"I don't want it," she said bitterly.
"I'd like to die!"</p>

<p>"If you stay around where I
am," Calhoun told her, "you
may get your wish. All right.
There'll be no more questions, I
promise."</p>

<p>She turned and moved toward
the door to the sleeping-cabin.
Calhoun looked after her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maril," he called out to her.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Why were you crying?"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't understand,"
she said evenly.</p>

<p>Calhoun shrugged his shoulders
almost up to his ears. He
was a professional man. In his
profession he was not incompetent.
But there is no profession
in which a really competent man
tries to understand women. Calhoun
annoyedly had to let fate
or chance or disaster take care
of Maril's personal problems. He
had larger matters to cope with.</p>

<p>But he had something to work
on, now. He hunted busily in the
reference tapes. He came up with
an explicit collection of information
on exactly the subject he
needed. He left the control-room
to go down into the storage areas
of the Med Ship's hull. He found
an ultra-frigid storage box,
whose contents were kept at the
temperature of liquid air. He
donned thick gloves, used a special
set of tongs, and extracted a
tiny block of plastic in which a
sealed-tight phial of glass was
embedded. It frosted instantly
he took it out, and when the storage-box
was closed again the
block was covered with a thick
and opaque coating of frozen
moisture.</p>

<p>He went back to the control-room
and pulled down the panel
which made available a small-scale
but surprisingly adequate
biological laboratory. He set the
plastic block in a container which
would raise it very, very gradually
to a specific temperature and
hold it there. It was, obviously, a
living culture from which any
imaginable quantity of the same
culture could be bred. Calhoun
set the apparatus with great exactitude.</p>

<p>"This," he told Murgatroyd,
"may be a good day's work. Now
I think I can rest."</p>

<p>Then, for a long while, there
was no sound or movement in the
Med Ship. The girl Maril may
have slept, or maybe not. Calhoun
lay relaxed in a chair which
at the touch of a button became
the most comfortable of sleeping-places.
Murgatroyd remained in
his cubbyhole, his tail curled
over his nose. There were comforting,
unheard, easily dismissable
murmurings now and
again. They kept the feeling of
life alive in the ship. But for such
infinitesimal stirrings of sound&mdash;carefully
recorded for this exact
purpose&mdash;the feel of the ship
would have been that of a tomb.</p>

<p>But it was quite otherwise
when another ship-day began
with the taped sounds of morning
activities as faint as echoes but
nevertheless establishing an atmosphere
of their own.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>Calhoun examined the plastic
block and its contents. He
read the instruments which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
cared for it while he slept. He
put the block&mdash;no longer frosted&mdash;in
the culture-microscope and
saw its enclosed, infinitesimal
particles of life in the process of
multiplying on the food that had
been frozen with them when they
were reduced to the spore condition.
He beamed. He replaced the
block in the incubation oven and
faced the day cheerfully.</p>

<p>Maril greeted him with great
reserve. They breakfasted.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking," said
Maril evenly. "I think I can get
you a hearing for&mdash;whatever
ideas you may have to help
Dara."</p>

<p>"Kind of you," murmured Calhoun.
"May I ask whose influence
you'll exert?"</p>

<p>"There's a man," said Maril reservedly,
"who&mdash;thinks a great
deal of me. I don't know his present
official position, but he was
certain to become prominent. I'll
tell him how you've acted up to
now, and your attitude, and of
course that you're Med Service.
He'll be glad to help you, I'm
sure."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" said Calhoun,
nodding. "That will be Korvan."</p>

<p>She started.</p>

<p>"How did you know?"</p>

<p>"Intuition," said Calhoun drily.
"All right. I'll count on him."</p>

<p>But he did not. He worked in
the tiny biological lab all that
ship-day and all the next. The
girl remained quiet.</p>

<p>On the ship-day after, the time
for breakfast approached. And
while the ship was practically a
world all by itself, it was easy to
look forward with confidence to
the future. But when contact and&mdash;in
a fashion&mdash;conflict with
other and larger worlds loomed
nearer, prospects seemed less
bright. Calhoun had definite
plans, now, but there were so
many ways in which they could
be frustrated! Weald's political
leaders could not oppose hysterical
demands for action against
blueskins, after a deathship arrived
with no signs whatever of
blueskins as responsible for its
cargo of corpses. It was certain
that a starving Dara would tend
to desperate and fatal measures
against hereditary enemies.</p>

<p>Calhoun sat down at the control-board
and watched the clock.</p>

<p>"I've got things lined up," he
told Maril wrily, "if only they
work out. <i>If</i> I can make somebody
on Dara listen and follow
my advice and <i>if</i> Weald doesn't
get ideas and isn't doing what I
suspect it is, maybe something
can be done."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you'll do your best,"
said Maril politely.</p>

<p>Calhoun managed to grin. He
watched the ship-clock. There
was no sensation attached to
overdrive travel except at the beginning
and the end. It was now
time for the end. He might find
that absolutely anything had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
happened while he made plans
which would immediately be seen
to be hopeless. Weald could have
sent ships to Dara, or Dara might
be in such a state of desperation
that ...</p>

<p>As it turned out, Dara was
desperate. The Med Ship came
out nearly a light-month from
the sun about which the planet
Dara revolved. Calhoun went into
a short hop toward it. Then
Dara was on the other side of the
blazing yellow star. It took time
to reach it. He called down, identifying
himself and the ship and
asking for co√∂rdinates so his
ship could be brought to ground.
There was confusion, as if the
request were so unusual that the
answers were not ready. The grid,
too, was on the planet's night
side. Presently the ship was
locked onto by the grid's force-fields.
It went downward without
incident.</p>

<p>Calhoun saw that Maril sat
tensely, twisting her fingers
within each other, until the ship
actually touched ground.</p>

<p>Then he opened the exit-port,
and faced armed men in the darkness,
with blast-rifles trained on
him. There was a portable cannon
trained on the Med Ship itself.</p>

<p>"Come out!" rasped a voice.
"If you try anything you get
blasted! Your ship and its contents
are seized by the planetary
government!"</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">CHAPTER 5</h2>


<p>It seemed that the smell of hunger
was in the air. The armed
men were cadaverous. Lights
came on, and stark, harsh shadows
lay black upon the ground.
Calhoun's captors were uniformed,
but the uniforms hung
loosely upon them. Where the
lights struck upon their faces,
their cheeks were hollow. They
were emaciated. And there were
the splotches of pigment of
which Calhoun had heard. The
leader of the truculent group
was blue, except for two fingers
which in the glaring illumination
seemed whiter than white.</p>

<p>"Out!" said that man savagely.
"We're taking over your stock
of food. You'll get your share of
it, like everybody else, but&mdash;out!"</p>

<p>Maril spoke over Calhoun's
shoulder. She uttered a cryptic
sentence or two. It should have
amounted to identification, but
there was skepticism in the
the armed party.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're one of us, eh?"
said the guard-leader sardonically.
"You'll have a chance to prove
that! Come out of there!"</p>

<p>Calhoun spoke abruptly;</p>

<p>"This is a Med Ship," he said.
"There are medicines and bacterial
cultures, inside it. They
shouldn't be meddled with. Here
on Dara you've had enough of
plagues!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>The man with the blue hand
said as sardonically as before;</p>

<p>"I said the government was
taking over your ship! It won't
be looted. But you're not taking
a full cargo of food away! In
fact, it's not likely you're leaving!"</p>

<p>"I want to speak to someone
in authority," snapped Calhoun.
"We've just come from Weald."
He felt bristling hatred all about
him as he named Weald. "There's
tumult there. They're talking
about dropping fusion bombs
here. It's important that I talk to
somebody with the authority to
take a few sensible precautions!"</p>

<p>He descended to the ground.
There was a panicky "<i>Chee!
Chee!</i>" from behind him, and
Murgatroyd came dashing to
swarm up his body and cling apprehensively
to his neck.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"A <i>tormal,</i>" said Calhoun.
"He's not a pet. Your medical
men will know something about
him. This is a Med Ship and I'm
a Med Ship man, and he's an important
member of the crew. He's
a Med Ship <i>tormal</i> and he stays
with me!"</p>

<p>The man with the blue hand
said harshly;</p>

<p>"There's somebody waiting to
ask you questions. Here!"</p>

<p>A ground-car came rolling out
from the side of the landing-grid
enclosure. The ground-car ran on
wheels, and wheels were not
much used on modern worlds.
Dara was behind the times in
more ways than one.</p>

<p>"This car will take you to Defense
and you can tell them anything
you want. But don't try to
sneak back in this ship! It'll be
guarded!"</p>

<p>The ground-car was enclosed,
with room for a driver and the
three from the Med Ship. But
armed men festooned themselves
about its exterior and it went
bumping and rolling to the massive
ground-layer girders of the
grid. It rolled out under them
and there was paved highway. It
picked up speed.</p>

<p>There were buildings on either
side of the road, but few showed
lights. This was night-time, and
the men at the landing-grid had
set a pattern of hunger, so that
the silence and the dark buildings
did not seem a sign of tranquility
and sleep, but of exhaustion
and despair. The highway
lamps were few, by comparison
with other inhabited worlds, and
the ground-car needed lights of
its own to guide its driver over
a paved surface that needed repair.
By those moving lights other
depressing things could be
seen. Untidiness. Buildings not
kept up to perfection. Evidences
of apathy. The road hadn't been
cleaned lately. There was litter
here and there.</p>

<p>Even the fact that there were
no stars added to the feeling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
wretchedness and gloom and&mdash;ultimately&mdash;of
hunger.</p>

<p>Maril spoke nervously to the
driver.</p>

<p>"The famine isn't any better?"</p>

<p>He moved his head in negation,
but did not speak.</p>

<p>"I left&mdash;two years ago," said
Maril. "It was just beginning
then. Rationing hadn't started
then&mdash;."</p>

<p>The driver said evenly;</p>

<p>"There's rationing now!"</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>The car went on and on. A vast
open space appeared ahead.
Lights about its perimeter
seemed few and pale.</p>

<p>"E-everything seems&mdash;worse.
Even the lights."</p>

<p>"Using all the power," said the
driver, "to warm up ground to
grow crops where it ought to be
winter. Not doing too well, either."</p>

<p>Calhoun knew, somehow, that
Maril moistened her lips.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;was sent," she explained
to the driver, "to go ashore on
Trent and then make my way to
Weald. I&mdash;mailed reports of what
I found out back to Trent. Somebody
got them back to here whenever&mdash;it
was possible."</p>

<p>The driver said;</p>

<p>"Everybody knows the man on
Trent disappeared. Maybe he got
caught, maybe somebody saw
him without makeup. Or maybe
he just quit being one of us.
What's the difference? No use!"</p>

<p>Calhoun found himself wincing
a little. The driver was not angry.
He was hopeless. But men should
not despair. They shouldn't accept
hostility from those about
them as a device of fate for their
destruction. They shouldn't ...</p>

<p>Maril said quickly to him;</p>

<p>"You understand? Dara's a
heavy-metals planet. There aren't
many light elements in our soil.
Potassium is scarce. So our
ground isn't very fertile. Before
the Plague we traded heavy
metals and manufactures for imports
of food and potash. But
since the Plague we've had no
off-planet commerce. We've been&mdash;quarantined."</p>

<p>"I gathered as much," said Calhoun.
"It was up to Med Service
to see that that didn't happen.
It's up to Med Service now to see
that it stops."</p>

<p>"Too late now for anything,"
said the driver, "whatever Med
Service may be! They're talking
about cutting down our population
so there'll be food enough
for some to live. There are two
questions about it: who's to be
kept alive and why."</p>

<p>The ground-car aimed now for
a cluster of faintly brighter
lights on the far side of the great
open space. They enlarged as they
grew nearer. Maril said hesitantly;</p>

<p>"There was someone&mdash;Korvan&mdash;"
Calhoun didn't catch the rest
of the name, Maril said hesitant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>ly;
"He was working on food-plants.
I&mdash;thought he might accomplish
something ..."</p>

<p>The driver said caustically;</p>

<p>"Sure! Everybody's heard
about him! He came up with a
wonderful thing! He and his outfit
worked out a way to process
weeds so they can be eaten. And
they can. You can fill your belly
and not feel hungry, but it's like
eating hay. You starve just the
same. He's still working. Head
of a government division."</p>

<p>The ground-car passed through
a gate. It stopped before a lighted
door. The armed men hanging
to its outside dropped off. They
watched Calhoun closely as he
stepped out with Murgatroyd riding
on his shoulder.</p>

<p>Minutes later they faced a hastily-summoned
group of officials
of the Darian government. For
a ship to land on Dara was so remarkable
an event that it called
practically for a cabinet meeting.
And Calhoun noted that they
were no better fed than the
guards at the space-port.</p>

<p>They regarded Calhoun and
Maril with oddly burning eyes.
It was, of course, because the
two of them showed no signs of
hunger. They obviously had not
been on short rations.</p>

<p>"My name is Calhoun," said
Calhoun briskly. "I've the usual
Med Service credentials. Now ..."</p>

<p>He did not wait to be questioned.
He told them of the appalling
state of things in the
Twelfth Sector of the Med Service,
so that men had been borrowed
from other sectors to remedy
the intolerable, and he was
one of them. He told of his arrival
at Weald and what had
happened there, from the excessively
cautious insistence that he
prove he was not a Darian, to the
arrival of the death-ship from
Orede. He was giving them the
news affecting them, as they had
not heard it before.</p>

<p>He went on to tell of his stop
at Orede and his purpose, and
his encounter with the men he
found there. When he finished
there was silence. He broke it.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "Maril's an
agent of yours. She can add to
what I've told you. I'm Med Service.
I have a job to do here to
repair what wasn't done before.
I should make a planetary health
inspection and make recommendations
for the improvement of
the state of things. I'll be glad if
you'll arrange for me to talk to
your health officials. Things look
bad, and something should be
done."</p>

<p>Someone laughed without
mirth.</p>

<p>"What will you recommend
for long-continued undernourishment?"
he asked derisively.
"That's our health problem!"</p>

<p>"I recommend food," said Calhoun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where'll you fill the prescription?"</p>

<p>"I've the answer to that, too,"
said Calhoun curtly. "I'll want to
talk to any space-pilots you've
got. Get your astrogators together
and I think they'll approve
my idea."</p>

<p>The silence was totally skeptical.</p>

<p>"Orede ..."</p>

<p>"Not Orede," said Calhoun.
"Weald will be hunting that planet
over for Darians. If they find
any, they'll drop bombs here."</p>

<p>"Our only space-pilots," said a
tall man, presently, "are on
Orede now. If you've told the
truth, they'll probably head
back because of your warning.
They should bring meat."</p>

<p>His mouth worked peculiarly,
and Calhoun knew that it was at
the thought of food.</p>

<p>"Which," said another man
sharply, "goes to the hospitals! I
haven't tasted meat in two
years!"</p>

<p>"Nobody has," growled another
man still. "But here's this man
Calhoun. I'm not convinced he
can work magic, but we can find
out if he lies. Put a guard on his
ship. Otherwise let our health
men give him his head. They'll
find out if he's from this Medical
Service he tells of! And this
Maril&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;can be identified," said
Maril. "I was sent to gather information
and sent it in secret
writing to one of us on Trent.
I have a family here. They'll
know me! And I&mdash;there was
someone who was working on
foods, and I believe he&mdash;made it
possible to use&mdash;all sorts of vegetation
for food. He will identify
me."</p>

<p>Someone laughed harshly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said a man with a
blue forehead. "He's a valuable
man! Within the year he's come
up with a way to make his weeds
taste like any food one chooses.
If we decide to cut our population,
we'll simply give the people
to be eliminated all they want to
eat of his products. They'll not
be hungry. They'll be quite happy.
But they'll die for lack of
nourishment. He's volunteered to
prove it painless by going
through it himself!"</p>

<p>Maril swallowed.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see him," she repeated.
"And my family."</p>

<p>Some of the blue-splotched
men turned away. A broad-shouldered
man said bluntly;</p>

<p>"Don't look for them to be
glad to see you. And you'd better
not show yourself in public.
You've been well fed. You'll be
hated for that."</p>

<p>Maril began to cry. Murgatroyd
said bewilderedly;</p>

<p>"<i>Chee! Chee!</i>"</p>

<p>Calhoun held him close. There
was confusion. And Calhoun
found the Minister of Health at
hand&mdash;he looked most harried of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
all the officials gathered to question
Calhoun&mdash;and proposed that
he get a look at the hospital situation
right away.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>It wasn't practical. With all the
population on half rations or
less, when night came people
needed to sleep. Most people, indeed,
slept as many hours out of
the traditional twenty-four as
they could manage. It was much
more pleasant to sleep than to
be awake and constantly nagged
at by continued hunger. And
there was the matter of simple
decency. Continuous gnawing
hunger had an embittering effect
upon everyone. Quarrelsomeness
was a common experience.
And people who would normally
be the leaders of opinion felt
shame because they were obsessed
by thoughts of food. It
was best when people slept.</p>

<p>Still, Calhoun was in the hospitals
by daybreak. What he
found moved him to savage anger.
There were too many sick
children. In every case undernourishment
contributed to their
sickness. And there was not
enough food to make them well.
Doctors and nurses denied themselves
food to spare it for their
patients.</p>

<p>Calhoun brought out hormones
and enzymes and medicaments
from the Med Ship while the
guard in the ship looked on. He
demonstrated the processes of
synthesis and autocatalysis that
enabled such small samples to be
multiplied indefinitely. He was
annoyed by a clamorous appetite.
There were some doctors who
ignored the irony of medical
techniques being taught to cure
non-nutritional disease, when
everybody was half-fed, or less.
They approved of Calhoun. They
even approved of Murgatroyd
when Calhoun explained his
function.</p>

<p>He was, of course, a Med Service
<i>tormal</i>, and <i>tormals</i> were creatures
of talent. They'd originally
been found on a planet in the
Deneb area, and they were engaging
and friendly small animals,
but the remarkable fact
about them was that they couldn't
contract any disease. Not any.
They had a built-in, explosive reaction
to bacterial and viral toxins,
and there hadn't yet been
any pathogenic organism discovered
to which a <i>tormal</i> could
not more or less immediately develop
antibody-resistance. So
that in interstellar medicine <i>tormals</i>
were priceless. Let Murgatroyd
be infected with however
localized, however specialized an
inimical organism, and presently
some highly valuable defensive
substance could be isolated from
his blood and he'd remain in his
usual exuberant good health.
When the antibody was analyzed
by those techniques of microanalysis
the Service had devel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>oped,&mdash;why&mdash;that
was that. The
antibody could be synthesized
and one could attack any epidemic
with confidence.</p>

<p>The tragedy for Dara was, of
course, that no Med Ship had
come there, three generations
ago, when the Dara plague raged.
Worse, after the plague Weald
was able to exert pressure which
only a criminally incompetent
Med Service director would have
permitted. But criminal incompetence
and its consequences was
what Calhoun had been loaned to
Sector Twelve to help remedy.</p>

<p>He was not at ease, though. No
ship arrived from Orede to bear
out his account of an attempt to
get that lonely world evacuated
before Weald discovered it had
blueskins on it. Maril had vanished,
to visit or return to her
family, or perhaps to consult
with the mysterious Korvan
who'd arranged for her to leave
Dara to be a spy, and had advised
her simply to make a new
life somewhere else, abandoning
a famine-ridden, despised, and
outcast world. Calhoun had
learned of two achievements the
same Korvan had made for his
world. Neither was remarkably
constructive. He'd offered to
prove the value of the second by
dying of it. Which might make
him a very admirable character,
or he could have a passion for
martyrdom,&mdash;which is much
more common than most people
think. In two days Calhoun was
irritable enough from unaccustomed
hunger to suspect the
worst of him.</p>

<p>And there was Weald to worry
about. Weald was hysterically
resolved to end what it considered
the blueskin menace for
once and for all. There were parallels
to such unreasoning frenzy
even in the ancient history of
Earth. A word still remained in
the dictionaries referring to it.
Genocide.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>Meanwhile Calhoun
worked doggedly; in the
hospitals while the patients were
awake and in the Med Ship&mdash;under
guard&mdash;afterward. He had
hunger cramps now, but he tested
a plastic cube with a thriving
biological culture in it. He
worked at increasing his store of
it. He'd snipped samples of pigmented
skin from dead patients
in the hospitals, and examined
the pigmented areas, and very,
very painstakingly verified a theory.
It took an electron microscope
to do it, but he found a
virus in the blue patches which
matched the type discovered on
Tralee. The Tralee viruses had
effects which were passed on
from mother to child, and heredity
had been charged with the observed
results of quasi-living
viral particles. And then Calhoun
very, very carefully introduced
into a virus culture the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
material he had been growing in
a plastic cube. He watched what
happened.</p>

<p>He was satisfied, so much so
that immediately afterward he
barely managed to stagger off to
bed.</p>

<p>That night the ship from Orede
came in, packed with frozen
bloody carcasses of cattle. Calhoun
knew nothing of it. But
next morning Maril came back.
There were shadows under her
eyes and her expression was of
someone who has lost everything
that had meaning in her life.</p>

<p>"I'm all right," she insisted,
when Calhoun commented. "I've
been visiting my family. I've
seen&mdash;Korvan. I'm quite all
right."</p>

<p>"You haven't eaten any better
than I have," Calhoun observed.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;couldn't!" admitted Maril.
"My sisters&mdash;my little sisters&mdash;so
thin.... There's rationing
for everybody and it's all efficiently
arranged. They even had
rations for me. But I couldn't
eat! I&mdash;gave most of my food to
my sisters and they&mdash;squabbled
over it!"</p>

<p>Calhoun said nothing. There
was nothing to say. Then she
said in a no less desolate tone;</p>

<p>"Korvan said I was foolish to
come back."</p>

<p>"He could be right," said Calhoun.</p>

<p>"But I had to!" protested
Maril. "Because I&mdash;I've been eating
all I wanted to, on Weald and
in the ship, and I'm ashamed
because they're half-starved and
I'm not. And when you see what
hunger does to them ... It's
terrible to be half-starved and
not able to think of anything but
food!"</p>

<p>"I hope," said Calhoun, "to do
something about that. If I can
get hold of an astrogator or two."</p>

<p>"The&mdash;ship that was on Orede
came in during the night," Maril
told him shakily. "It was loaded
with frozen meat, but one
ship-load's not enough to make a
difference on a whole planet! And
if Weald hunts for us on Orede,
we daren't go back for more
meat."</p>

<p>She said abruptly;</p>

<p>"There are some prisoners.
They were miners. They were
crowded out of the ship. The
Darians who'd stampeded the
cattle took them prisoners. They
had to!"</p>

<p>"True," said Calhoun. "It
wouldn't have been wise to leave
Wealdians around on Orede with
their throats cut. Or living, either,
to tell about a rumor of blueskins.
Even if their throats will
be cut now. Is that the program?"</p>

<p>Maril shivered.</p>

<p>"No ... They'll be put on
short rations like everybody else.
And people will watch them. The
Wealdians expect to die of plague
any minute because they've been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
with Darians. So people look at
them and laugh. But it's not funny."</p>

<p>"It's natural," said Calhoun,
"but perhaps lacking in charity.
Look here! How about those astrogators?
I need them for a job
I have in mind."</p>

<p>Maril wrung her hands.</p>

<p>"C&mdash;come here," she said in a
low tone.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>There was an armed guard in
the control-room of the ship.
He'd watched Calhoun a good
part of the previous day as Calhoun
performed his mysterious
work. He'd been off-duty and
now was on duty again. He was
bored. So long as Calhoun did
not touch the control-board,
though, he was uninterested. He
didn't even turn his head when
Maril led the way into the other
cabin and slid the door shut.</p>

<p>"The astrogators are coming,"
she said swiftly. "They'll bring
some boxes with them. They'll
ask you to instruct them so they
can handle our ship better. They
lost themselves coming back
from Orede, no, they didn't lose
themselves, but they lost time&mdash;enough
time almost to make an
extra trip for meat. They need
to be experts. I'm to come along,
so they can be sure that what you
teach them is what you've been
doing right along."</p>

<p>Calhoun said;</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"They're crazy!" said Maril
vehemently. "They knew Weald
would do something monstrous
sooner or later. But they're going
to try to stop it by more
monstrousness sooner! Not everybody
agrees, but there are
enough. So they want to use your
ship&mdash;it's faster in overdrive and
so on. And they'll go to Weald&mdash;in
this ship&mdash;and&mdash;they say
they'll give Weald something to
keep it busy without bothering
us!"</p>

<p>Calhoun said drily;</p>

<p>"This pays me off for being
too sympathetic with blueskins!
But if I'd been hungry for a
couple of years, and was despised
to boot by the people who kept
me hungry, I suppose I might
react the same way. No," he said
curtly as she opened her lips to
speak again. "Don't tell me the
trick. Considering everything,
there's only one trick it could be.
But I doubt profoundly that it
would work. All right."</p>

<p>He slid the door back and returned
to the control-room. Maril
followed him. He said detachedly;</p>

<p>"I've been working on a problem
outside of the food one. It
isn't the time to talk about it
right now, but I think I've solved
it."</p>

<p>Maril turned her head, listening.
There were footsteps on the
tarmac outside the ship. Both
doors of the airlock were open.
Four men came in. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
young men who did not look quite
as hungry as most Darians, but
there was a reason for that. Their
leader introduced himself and
the others. They were the astrogators
of the ship Dara had built
to try to bring food from Orede.
They were not good enough, said
their self-appointed leader. They
overshot their destination. They
came out of overdrive too far off
line. They needed instructions.</p>

<p>Calhoun nodded, and observed
that he'd been asking for them.</p>

<p>"We've got orders," said their
leader, steadily, "to come on
board and learn from you how to
handle this ship. It's better than
the one we've got."</p>

<p>"I asked for you," repeated
Calhoun. "I've an idea I'll explain
as we go along. Those boxes?"</p>

<p>Someone was passing in iron
boxes through the airlock. One
of the four very carefully brought
them inside.</p>

<p>"They're rations," said a second
young man. "We don't go
anywhere without rations&mdash;except
Orede."</p>

<p>"Orede, yes. I think we were
shooting at each other there,"
said Calhoun pleasantly. "Weren't
we?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the young man.</p>

<p>He was neither cordial nor antagonistic.
He was impassive. Calhoun shrugged.</p>

<p>"Then we can take off immediately.
Here's the communicator
and there's the button. You
might call the grid and arrange
for us to be lifted."</p>

<p>The young man seated himself
at the control-board. Very professionally,
he went through the
routine of preparing to lift by
landing-grid, which routine has
not changed in two hundred
years. He went briskly ahead until
the order to lift. Then Calhoun
stopped him.</p>

<p>"Hold it!"</p>

<p>He pointed to the airlock. Both
doors were open. The young man
at the control-board flushed vividly.
One of the others closed and
dogged the doors.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>The ship lifted. Calhoun
watched with seeming negligence.
But he found occasion for
a dozen corrections of procedure.
This was presumably a training
voyage of his own suggestion.
Therefore when the blueskin pilot
would have flung the Med Ship
into undirected overdrive, Calhoun
grew stern. He insisted on
a destination. He suggested
Weald. The young men glanced
at each other and accepted the
suggestion. He made the acting
pilot look up the intrinsic business
of its sun and measure its
apparent brightness from just
off Dara. He made him estimate
the change in brightness to be
expected after so many hours in
overdrive, if one broke out to
measure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>The first blueskin student pilot
ended a Calhoun-determined
tour of duty with rather more of
respect for Calhoun than he'd
had at the beginning. The second
was anxious to show up better
than the first. Calhoun drilled
him in the use of brightness-charts,
by which the changes in
apparent brightness of stars between
overdrive hops could be
correlated with angular changes
to give a three-dimensional picture
of the nearer heavens. It was
a highly necessary art which had
not been worked out on Dara, and
the prospective astrogators became
absorbed in this and other
fine points of space-piloting.
They'd done enough, in a few
trips to Orede, to realize that
they needed to know more. Calhoun
showed them.</p>

<p>Calhoun did not try to make
things easy for them. He was
hungry and easily annoyed. It
was sound training tactics to be
severe, and to phrase all suggestions
as commands. He put the
four young men in command of
the ship in turn, under his direction.
He continued to use Weald
as a destination, but he set up
problems in which the Med Ship
came out of overdrive pointing
in an unknown direction and with
a precessory motion. He made
the third of his students identify
Weald in the celestial globe
containing hundreds of millions
of stars, and get on course in
overdrive toward it. The fourth
was suddenly required to compute
the distance to Weald from
such data as he could get from
observation, without reference
to any records.</p>

<p>By this time the first man was
chafing to take a second turn.
Calhoun gave each of them a
second gruelling lesson. He gave
them, in fact, a highly condensed
but very sound course in the art
of travel in space. His young
students took command in four-hour
watches, with at least one
breakout from overdrive in each
watch. He built up enthusiasm
in them. They ignored the discomfort
of being hungry, though
there had been no reason for
them to stint on food in Orede&mdash;in
growing pride in what they
came to know.</p>

<p>When Weald was a first-magnitude
star, the four were not highly
qualified astrogators, to be
sure, but they were vastly better
spacemen than at the beginning.
Inevitably, their attitude toward
Calhoun was respectful. He'd
been irritable and right. To the
young, the combination is impressive.</p>

<p>Maril had served as passenger
only. In theory she was to compare
Calhoun's lessons with his
practise when alone. But he did
nothing on this journey which&mdash;teaching
considered&mdash;was different
from the two interstellar
journeys Maril had made with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
him. She occupied the sleeping-cabin
during two of the six
watches of each ship-day. She
operated the food-readier, which
was almost completely emptied
of its original store of food;&mdash;confiscated
by the government
of Dara. That amount of food
would make no difference to the
planet, but it was wise for everyone
on Dara to be equally ill-fed.</p>

<p>On the sixth day out from
Dara, the sun of Weald had a
magnitude of minus five-tenths.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
The electron telescope could detect
its larger planets, especially
a gas-giant fifth-orbit world of
high albedo. Calhoun had his
four students estimate its distance
again, pointing out the difference
that could be made in
breakout position if the Med
Ship were mis-aimed by as much
as one second of arc.</p>

<p>"That does it," Calhoun announced
cheerfully. "That's the
last order I'll give you. You're
graduate pilots from here on!
Relax and have some coffee."</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>"And now," said Calhoun, "I
suppose you'll tell me the
truth about those boxes you
brought on board. You said they
were rations, but they haven't
been opened in six days. I have
an idea what they mean, but you
tell me."</p>

<p>The four looked uncomfortable.
There was a long pause.</p>

<p>"They could be," said Calhoun
detachedly, "cultures to be
dumped on Weald. Weald is
making plans to wipe out Dara.
So some fool has decided to get
Weald too busy fighting a plague
of its own to bother with you. Is
that right?"</p>

<p>The young men stirred uneasily.
"Well&mdash;l&mdash;l, sir," said one of
them, unhappily, "that's what we
were ordered to do."</p>

<p>"I object," said Calhoun. "It
wouldn't work. I just left Weald
a little while back, remember.
They've been telling themselves
that some day Dara would try
that. They've made preparations
to fight any imaginable contagion
you could drop on them. Every
so often somebody claims it's
happening. It wouldn't work."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In fact," said Calhoun, "I
will not permit you to do anything
of the kind."</p>

<p>One of the young men, staring
at Calhoun, nodded suddenly.
His eyes closed. He jerked his
head erect and looked bewildered.
A second sank heavily into a
chair. He said remotely, "Thish
sfunny!" and abruptly went to
sleep. The third found his knees
giving away. He paid elaborate
attention to them, stiffening
them. But they yielded like rubber
and he went slowly down to
the floor. The fourth said thickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
with difficulty, yet reproachfully;</p>

<p>"'Thought y'were our frien'!"</p>

<p>He collapsed.</p>

<p>Calhoun very soberly tied
them hand and foot and laid
them out comfortably on the
floor. Maril watched, white-faced,
her hand to her throat. "What
have you done to them? Are they
dead?"</p>

<p>"No," said Calhoun, "just
drugged. They'll wake up presently."</p>

<p>Maril said in a tense and desperate
whisper;</p>

<p>"You're&mdash;betraying us! You're
going to take us to Weald."</p>

<p>"No," said Calhoun. "We'll
only orbit around it. First,
though, I want to get rid of those
damned packed-up cultures.
They're dead, by the way. I
killed them with supersonics a
couple of days ago, while a fine
argument was going on about
distance-measurements by variable
Cepheids of known period."</p>

<p>He put the four boxes carefully
in the waste-disposal unit. He
operated it. The boxes and their
contents streamed out to space
in the form of metallic and other
vapors. Calhoun sat at the control-desk.</p>

<p>"I'm a Med Service man," he
said detachedly. "I couldn't cooperate
in the spread of plague,
anyhow, though a useful epidemic
might be another matter. But the
important thing right now is not
keeping Weald busy with troubles
to increase their hatred of Dara.
It's getting some food for Dara.
And driblets won't help. What's
needed is in thousands of tons,&mdash;or
tens of thousands." Then he
said; "Overdrive coming, Murgatroyd!
Hold fast!"</p>

<p>The universe vanished. The
customary unpleasant sensations
accompanied the change. Murgatroyd
burped.</p>

<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Earth's sun, from Earth, is of magnitude

<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">CHAPTER 6</h2>


<p>A large part of the firmament
was blotted out by the blindingly
bright half-disk of Weald,
as it shone in the sunshine. It had
ice-caps at its poles, and there
were seas, and the mottled look
of land which had that carefully
maintained balance of woodland
and cultivated areas which was
so effective in climate control.
The Med Ship floated free, and
Calhoun fretfully monitored all
the beacon frequencies known to
man.</p>

<p>There was relative silence inside
the ship. Maril watched Calhoun
in a sort of despairing indecision.
The four young blueskins
still slept, still bound hand
and foot upon the control-room
floor. Murgatroyd regarded them,
and Maril, and Calhoun in turn,
and his small and furry forehead
wrinkled helplessly.</p>

<p>"They can't have landed what
I'm looking for!" protested Calhoun
as his search had no result.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
"They can't. It would be too sensible
for them to have done it!"</p>

<p>Murgatroyd said "<i>Chee!</i>" in a
subdued voice.</p>

<p>"But where the devil did they
put them?" demanded Calhoun.
"A polar orbit would be ridiculous!
They&mdash;" Then he grunted
in disgust. "Oh! Of course!
Now, where's the landing-grid?"</p>

<p>He worked busily for minutes,
checking the position of the
Wealdian landing-grid&mdash;mapped
in the Sector Directory&mdash;against
the look of continents and seas
on the half-disk so plainly visible
outside. He found what he
wanted. He put on the ship's solar-system
drive.</p>

<p>"I wish," he complained to
Maril, "I wish I could think
straight the first time! And it's
so obvious! If you want to put
something out in space, and not
have it interfere with traffic, in
what sort of orbit and at what
distance will you put it?"</p>

<p>Maril did not answer.</p>

<p>"Obviously," said Calhoun,
"you'll put it as far as possible
from the landing-pattern of ships
coming in to the space-port.
You'll put it on the opposite side
of the planet. And you'll want it
to stay out of the way, where
anybody can know it is at any
time of the day or night without
having to calculate anything.
So you'll put it out in orbit so it
will revolve around Weald in exactly
one day, neither more or
less, and you'll put it above the
equator. And then it will remain
quite stationary above one spot
on the planet, a hundred and
eighty degrees longitude away
from the landing-grid and directly
over the equator."</p>

<p>He scribbled for a moment.</p>

<p>"Which means forty-two thousand
miles high, give or take a
few hundred, and&mdash;here! And I
was hunting for it in a close-in
orbit!"</p>

<p>He grumbled to himself. He
waited while the solar-system
drive pushed the Med Ship a
quarter of the way around the
bright planet below. The sunset
line vanished and the planet's
disk became a complete circle.
Then Calhoun listened to the
monitor earphones again, and
grunted once more, and changed
course, and presently made a
noise indicating satisfaction.</p>

<p>Again presently he abandoned
instrument-control and peered
directly out of a port, handling
the solar-system drive with great
care. Murgatroyd said depressedly;</p>

<p>"<i>Chee!</i>"</p>

<p>"Stop worrying," commanded
Calhoun. "We haven't been challenged,
and there is a beacon
transmitter at work, just to make
sure that nobody bumps into
what we're looking for. It's a
great help, because we do want to
bump,&mdash;gently."</p>

<p>Stars swung across the port<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
out of which he looked. Something
dark appeared,&mdash;and then
straight lines and exact curvings.
Even Maril, despairing and bewildered
as she was, caught sight
of something vastly larger than
the Med Ship, floating in space.
She stared. The Med Ship maneuvered
very cautiously. She
saw another large object. A third.
A fourth. There seemed to be
dozens of them.</p>

<p>They were space-ships, huge
by comparison with Aesclipus
Twenty. They floated as the Med
Ship did. They did not drive.
They were not in formation. They
were not at even distances from
each other. They did not point
in the same direction. They
swung in emptiness like derelicts.</p>

<p>Calhoun jockeyed his small
ship with infinite care. Presently
there came the gentlest of impacts
and then a clanking sound.
The appearance out the vision-port
became stationary, but still
unbelievable. The Med Ship was
grappled magnetically to a vast
surface of welded metal.</p>

<p>Calhoun relaxed. He opened a
wall-panel and brought out a
vacuum suit. He began briskly to
get it on.</p>

<p>"Things move smoothly," he
commented. "We weren't challenged.
So it's extremely unlikely
that we were spotted. Our friends
on the floor ought to begin to
come to shortly. And I'm going
to find out now whether I'm a
hero or in sure-enough trouble!"</p>

<p>Maril said drearily;</p>

<p>"I don't know what you've
done, except&mdash;"</p>

<p>Calhoun blinked at her, in the
act of hauling the vacuum suit
over his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Isn't it self-evident?" he demanded.
"I've been giving astrogation
lessons to these characters.
I certainly didn't do it to
help them dump germ-cultures
on Weald! I brought them here!
Don't you see the point? These
are space-ships. They're in orbit
around Weald. They're not
manned and they're not controlled.
In fact, they're nothing
but sky-riding storage bins!"</p>

<p>He seemed to consider the explanation
complete. He wriggled
his arms into the sleeves and
gloves of the suit. He slung the
air-tanks over his shoulder and
hooked them to the suit.</p>

<p>"I'll be back," he said. "I hope
with good news. I've reason to be
hopeful, though, because these
Wealdians are very practical
men. They have things all prepared
and tidy. I suspect I'll find
these ships with stores of air and
fuel&mdash;maybe even food&mdash;so that
if Weald should manage to make
a deal for the stuff stored out
here in them, they'd only have to
bring out crews."</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>He lifted the space-helmet
down from its rack and put it
on. He tested it, reading the tank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
air-pressure, power-storage, and
other data from the lighted
miniature instruments visible
through pinholes above his eye-level.
He fastened a space-rope
about himself, speaking through
the helmet's opened face-plate.</p>

<p>"If our friends should wake up
before I get back," he added,
"please restrain them. I'd hate to
be marooned."</p>

<p>He went waddling into the airlock
with the coil of space-rope
over one vacuum-suited arm. The
inner lock door closed behind him
A little later Maril heard the outer
lock open. Then soundlessness.</p>

<p>Murgatroyd whimpered a little.
Maril shivered. Calhoun had gone
out of the ship to nothingness.
He'd said that what he was looking
for&mdash;and what he'd found&mdash;was
forty-two thousand miles
from Weald. One could imagine
falling forty-two thousand miles,
where one couldn't imagine falling
a light-year. Calhoun was
walking on the steel plates of a
gigantic space-ship which floated
among dozens of its fellows,
all seeming derelicts and seemingly
abandoned. He was able to
walk on the nearest because of
magnetic-soled shoes. He trusted
his life to them and to a flimsy
space-rope which trailed after
him out the Med Ship's airlock.</p>

<p>Time passed. A clock ticked in
that hurried tempo of five ticks
to the second which has been the
habit of clocks since time immemorial.
Very small and trivial
noises came from the background
tape, preventing utter silence
from hanging intolerably in the
ship. They were traffic-sounds, recorded
on a world no one knew
how many light-years distant,
and nobody knew when. There
were sounds as of voices, too faint
to suggest words, but imparting
a feel of life and activity to a
soundless ship.</p>

<p>Maril found herself listening
tensely for something else. One
of the four bound blueskins
snored, and stirred, and slept
again. Murgatroyd gazed about
unhappily, and swung down to
the control-room floor, and then
paused for lack of any place to
go or thing to do. He sat down
and began half-heartedly to lick
his whiskers. Maril stirred.</p>

<p>Murgatroyd looked at her
hopefully.</p>

<p>"<i>Chee?</i>" he asked shrilly.</p>

<p>She shook her head. It became
a habit to act as if Murgatroyd
were a human being.</p>

<p>"N-no," she said unsteadily.
"Not yet."</p>

<p>More time passed. An unbearably
long time. Then there was
the faintest of clankings. It repeated.
Then, abruptly, there
were noises in the airlock. They
continued. They were fumbling
noises.</p>

<p>The outer airlock door closed.
The inner door opened. Dense
white fog came out of it. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
was motion. Calhoun followed the
fog out of the lock. He carried
objects which had been weightless,
but were suddenly heavy in
the ship's gravity-field. There
were two space-suits and a curious
assortment of parcels. He
spread them out, flipped aside the
face-plate, and said briskly;</p>

<p>"This stuff is cold! Turn a
heater on it, will you Maril?"</p>

<p>He began to work his way out
of his vacuum-suit.</p>

<p>"Item," he said. "The ships
are fuelled <i>and</i> provisioned. A
practical tribe, the Wealdians!
The ships are ready to take off as
soon as they're warmed up inside.
A half-degree sun doesn't radiate
heat enough to keep a ship warm,
when the rest of the cosmos is effectively
near zero Kelvin. Here,
point the heaters like this."</p>

<p>He adjusted the radiant-heat
dispensers. The fog disappeared
where their beams played. But
the metal space-suits glistened
and steamed,&mdash;and the steam disappeared
within inches. They
were so completely and utterly
cold that they condensed the air
about them as a liquid, which
re√´vaporated to make fog, which
warmed up and disappeared and
was immediately replaced.</p>

<p>"Item," said Calhoun again,
getting his arms out of the vacuum-suit
sleeves. "The controls
are pretty nearly standard. Our
sleeping friends will be able to
astrogate them back to Dara
without trouble, provided only
that nobody comes out here to
bother us before they leave."</p>

<p>He shed the last of the space-suit,
stepping out of its legs.</p>

<p>"And," he finished wrily, "I
brought back an emergency supply
of ship-provisions for everybody
concerned, but find that I'm
idiot enough to feel that they'll
choke me if I eat them while
Dara's still starving."</p>

<p>Maril said;</p>

<p>"But&mdash;there isn't any hope for
Dara! No real hope!"</p>

<p>He gaped at her.</p>

<p>"What do you think we're here
for?"</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>He set to work to restore his
four recent students to consciousness.
It was not a difficult
task. The dosage, mixed in the
coffee he had given them earlier,
was a light one. Calhoun took the
precaution of disarming them
first, but presently four hot-eyed
young men glared at him.</p>

<p>"I'm calling," said Calhoun,
holding a blaster negligently in
his hand, "I'm calling for volunteers.
There's a famine on Dara.
There've been unmanageable
crop-surpluses on Weald. On
Dara, the government grimly rations
every ounce of food. On
Weald, the government has been
buying up surplus grain to keep
the price up. To save storage
costs, it's loaded the grain into
out-of-date space-ships it once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
used to stand sentry over Dara
to keep it out of space when there
was another famine there. Those
ships have been put out in orbit,
where we're hooked on to one of
them. It's loaded with half a
million bushels of grain. I've
brought space-suits from it, I've
turned on the heaters in its interior,
and I've set its overdrive
unit for a hop to Dara. Now I'm
calling for volunteers to take half
a million bushels of grain to
where it's needed. Do I get any
volunteers?"</p>

<p>He got four. Not immediately,
because they were ashamed that
he'd made it impossible to carry
out their original fanatic plan,
and now offered something much
better to make up for it. They
raged. But half a million bushels
of grain meant that people who
must otherwise die might live.</p>

<p>Ultimately, truculently, first
one and then another angrily
agreed.</p>

<p>"Good!" said Calhoun. "Now,
how many of you dare risk the
trip alone? I've got one grain-ship
warming up. There are plenty
of others around us. Every
one of you can take a ship and
half a million bushels to Dara,
if you have the nerve?"</p>

<p>The atmosphere changed. Suddenly
they clamored for the task
he offered them. They were still
acutely uncomfortable. He'd
bossed them and taught them until
they felt capable and glamorous
and proud. Then he'd pinned
their ears back. But if they returned
to Dara with four enemy
ships and unimaginable quantities
of food with which to break
the famine....</p>

<p>There was work to be done
first, of course. Only one ship was
so far warming up. Three more
had to be entered, in space-suits,
and each had to have its interior
warmed so breathable air could
exist inside it, and at least part
of the stored provisions had to
be brought up to reasonable
temperature for use on the journey.
Then the overdrive unit had
to be inspected and set for the
length of journey that a direct
overdrive hop to Dara would
mean, and Calhoun had to make
sure again that each of the four
could identify Dara's sun under
all circumstances and aim for it
with the requisite high precision,
both before going into overdrive
and after breakout. When all that
was accomplished, Calhoun might
reasonably hope that they'd arrive.
But it wasn't a certainty.</p>

<p>Still, presently his four students
shook hands with him, with
the fine tolerance of young men
intending much greater achievements
than their teacher. They
wouldn't speak on communicator
again, because their messages
might be picked up on Weald.</p>

<p>Of course for this action to be
successful, it had to be performed
with the stealth of sneak-thieves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>What seemed a long time
passed. Then one ship
turned slowly upon some unseen
axis. It wavered back and forth,
seeking a point of aim. A second
twisted in its place. A third put
on the barest trace of solar-system
drive to get clear of the rest.
The fourth ...</p>

<p>One ship vanished. It had gone
into overdrive, heading for Dara
at many times the speed of light.
Another. Two more.</p>

<p>That was all. The remainder of
the fleet hung clumsily in emptiness.
And Calhoun worriedly
went over in his mind the lessons
he'd given in such a pathetically
small number of days. If the four
ships reached Dara, their pilots
would be heroes. Calhoun had
presented them with that estate
over their bitter objection. But
they would glory in it, if they
reached Dara.</p>

<p>Maril looked at him with very
strange eyes.</p>

<p>"Now what?" she asked.</p>

<p>"We hang around," said Calhoun,
"to see if anybody comes
up from Weald to find out what's
happened. It's always possible to
pick up a sort of signal when a
ship goes into overdrive. Usually
it doesn't mean a thing. Nobody
pays any attention. But if somebody
comes out here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"It'll be regrettable," said Calhoun.
He was suddenly very tired.
"It'll spoil any chance of our
coming back and stealing some
more food&mdash;like interstellar mice.
If they find out what we've done
they'll expect us to try it again.
They might get set to fight. Or
they might simply land the rest
of these ships."</p>

<p>"If I'd realized what you were
about," said Maril, "I'd have
joined in the lessons. I could have
piloted a ship."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't have wanted
to," said Calhoun. He yawned.
"You wouldn't want to be a heroine."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Korvan," said Calhoun. He
yawned again. "I've asked about
him. He's been trying very desperately
to deserve well of his fellow
blueskins. All he's accomplished
is develop a way to starve
painlessly. He wouldn't feel comfortable
with a girl who'd helped
make starving unnecessary. He'd
admire you politely, but he'd
never marry you. And you know
it."</p>

<p>She shook her head, but it was
not easy to tell whether she denied
the reaction of Korvan&mdash;whom
Calhoun had never met&mdash;or
denied that he was more important
to her than anything else.
The last was what Calhoun plainly
implied.</p>

<p>"You don't seem to be trying to
be a hero!" she protested.</p>

<p>"I'd enjoy it," admitted Calhoun,
"but I have a job to do. It's
got to be done. It's much more im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>portant
than being admired."</p>

<p>"You could take another ship
back," she told him. "It would be
worth more to Dara than the
Med Ship is! And then everybody
would realize that you'd
planned everything."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Calhoun. "But
you've no idea how much this ship
matters to Dara!"</p>

<p>He seated himself at the controls.
He slipped headphones over
his ears. He listened. Very, very
carefully, he monitored all the
wave-lengths and wave-forms he
could discover in use on Weald.
There was no mention of the oddity
of behavior of shiploads of
surplus grain aloft. There was no
mention of the ships at all. But
there was plenty of mention of
Dara, and blueskins, and of the
vicious political fight now going
on to see which political party
could promise the most complete
protection against blueskins.</p>

<p>After a full hour of it, Calhoun
flipped off his receptor and swung
the Med Ship to an exact, painstakingly
precise aim at the sun
around which Dara rolled. He
said;</p>

<p>"Overdrive coming, Murgatroyd!"</p>

<p>Murgatroyd grabbed. The stars
went out and the universe reeled
and the Med Ship became a sort
of cosmos all its own.</p>

<p>Calhoun yawned again.</p>

<p>"Now there's nothing to be
done for a day or two," he said
wearily, "and I'm beginning to
understand why people sleep all
they can, on Dara. It's one way
not to feel hungry."</p>

<p>Maril said tensely;</p>

<p>"You're going back? After
they took the ship from you?"</p>

<p>"The job's not finished," he explained.
"Not even the famine's
ended, and the famine's a second-order
effect. If there were no such
thing as a blueskin, there'd be no
famine. Food could be traded for.
We've got to do something to
make sure there are no more
famines."</p>

<p>She looked at him oddly.</p>

<p>"It would be desirable," she
said with irony. "But you can't
do it."</p>

<p>"Not today, no," he admitted.
Then he said longingly, "I'm
about to catch up on some sleep."</p>

<p>Maril rose and went into the
other cabin. He settled down into
the chair and fell instantly asleep.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>For very many ship-hours,
then, there was no action or
activity or happening of any imaginable
consequence in the Med
Ship. Very, very far away, light-years
distant and light years
apart, four shiploads of grain
hurtled toward the famine-stricken
planet of blueskins. Each
great ship had a single semi-skilled
blueskin for pilot and
crew. Thousands of millions of
suns blazed with violence appropriate
to their stellar types in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
galaxy of which a very small
proportion had been explored and
colonized by humanity. The human
race was now to be counted
in quadrillions on scores of hundreds
of inhabited worlds, but the
tiny Med Ship seemed the least
significant of all possible created
things. It could travel between
star-systems and even star-clusters,
but it was not yet capable
of crossing the continent of suns
on which the human race arose.
And between any two solar systems
the journeying of the Med
Ship consumed much time. Which
would be maddening for someone
with no work to do or no resources
in himself, or herself.</p>

<p>On the second ship-day Calhoun
labored painstakingly and
somewhat distastefully at the
little biological laboratory. Maril
watched him in a sort of brooding
silence. Murgatroyd slept
much of the time, with his furry
tail wrapped meticulously across
his nose.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the day Calhoun
finished his task. He had
a matter of six or seven cubic
centimeters of clear liquid as the
conclusion of a long process of
culturing, and examination by
microscope, and again culturing
plus final filtration. He looked at
a clock and calculated time.</p>

<p>"Better wait until tomorrow,"
he observed, and put the bit of
clear liquid in a temperature-controlled
place of safe-keeping.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Maril.
"What's it for?"</p>

<p>"It's part of a job I have on
hand," said Calhoun. He considered.
"How about some music?"</p>

<p>She looked astonished. But he
set up an instrument and fed
microtape into it and settled back
to listen. Then there was music
such as she had never heard before.
Again it was a device to
counteract isolation and monotonous
between-planet voyages. To
keep it from losing its effectiveness,
Calhoun rationed himself on
music, as on other things. Calhoun
deliberately went for weeks
between uses of his recordings,
so that music was an event to be
looked forward to and cherished.</p>

<p>When he tapered off the stirring
symphonies of Kun Gee
with tranquilizing, soothing melodies
from the Rim School of
composers, Maril regarded him
with a very peculiar gaze indeed.</p>

<p>"I think I understand now,"
she said slowly, "why you don't
act like other people. Toward me,
for example. The way you live
gives you what other people have
to try to get in crazy ways,&mdash;making
their work feed their vanity,
and justify pride, and make
them feel significant. But you
can put your whole mind on your
work."</p>

<p>He thought it over.</p>

<p>"Med Ship routine is designed
to keep one healthy in his mind,"
he admitted. "It works pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
well. It satisfies all my mental
appetites. But naturally there are
instincts&mdash;"</p>

<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image">
<img src="images/i070.jpg" width="575" height="427" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>She waited. He did not finish.</p>

<p>"What do you do about instincts
that work and music and
such things can't satisfy?"</p>

<p>Calhoun grinned wrily;</p>

<p>"I'm stern with them. I have
to be."</p>

<p>He stood up and plainly expected
her to go into the other cabin
for the night. She did.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>It was after breakfast-time of
the next ship-day when he got
out the sample of clear liquid
he'd worked so long to produce.
"We'll see how it works," he
observed. "Murgatroyd's handy
in case of a slip-up. It's perfectly
safe so long as he's aboard
and there are only the two of us."</p>

<p>She watched as he injected half
a cc under his own skin. Then
she shivered a little.</p>

<p>"What will it do?"</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen." He
paused a moment. "You and I," he
said with some dryness, "make a
perfect test for anything. If you
catch something from me, it will
be infective indeed!"</p>

<p>She gazed at him utterly without
comprehension.</p>

<p>He took his own temperature.
He brought out the folios which
were his orders, covering each of
the planets he should give a
standard Medical Service inspection.
Weald was there. Dara
wasn't. But a Med Service man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
has much freedom of action, even
when only keeping up the routine
of normal Med Service. When
catching up on badly neglected
operations, he necessarily has
much more. Calhoun went over
the folios.</p>

<p>Two hours later he took his
temperature again. He looked
pleased. He made an entry in the
ship's log. Two hours later yet
he found himself drinking thirstily
and looked more pleased still.
He made another entry in the log
and matter-of-factly drew a
small quantity of blood from his
own vein and called to Murgatroyd.
Murgatroyd submitted
amiably to the very trivial operation
Calhoun carried out. Calhoun
put away the equipment and
saw Maril staring at him with a
certain look of shock.</p>

<p>"It doesn't hurt him," Calhoun
explained. "Right after he's born
there's a tiny spot on his flank
that has the pain-nerves desensitized.
Murgatroyd's all right.
That's what he's for!"</p>

<p>"But he's&mdash;your friend!"</p>

<p>"He's my assistant. I don't ask
anything of him that I can do
myself. But we're both Med Service.
And I do things for him that
he can't do for himself. For example,
I make coffee for him."</p>

<p>Murgatroyd heard the familiar
word. He said;</p>

<p>"<i>Chee!</i>"</p>

<p>"Very well," agreed Calhoun.
"We'll all have some."</p>

<p>He made coffee. Murgatroyd
sipped at the cup especially
made for his little paws. Once he
scratched at the place on his
flank which had no pain-nerves.
It itched. But he was perfectly
content. Murgatroyd would always
be contented when he was
somewhere near Calhoun.</p>

<p>Another hour went by. Murgatroyd
climbed up into Calhoun's
lap and with a determined air
went to sleep there. Calhoun disturbed
him long enough to get an
instrument out of his pocket. He
listened to Murgatroyd's heartbeat
with it while Murgatroyd
dozed.</p>

<p>"Maril," he said. "Write down
something for me. The time, and
ninety-six, and one-twenty over
ninety-four."</p>

<p>She obeyed, not comprehending.
Half an hour later&mdash;still not
stirring to disturb Murgatroyd&mdash;he
had her write down another
time and sequence of figures, only
slightly different from the first.
Half an hour later still, a third
set. But then he put Murgatroyd
down, well satisfied.</p>

<p>He took his own temperature.
He nodded.</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd and I have one
more chore to do," he told her.
"Would you go in the other cabin
for a moment?"</p>

<p>She went disturbedly into the
other cabin. Calhoun drew a sample
of blood from the insensitive
area on Murgatroyd's flank.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Murgatroyd submitted with complete
confidence in the man. In
ten minutes Calhoun had diluted
the sample, added an anticoagulant,
shaken it up thoroughly,
and filtered it to clarity with all
red and white corpuscles removed.
Another Med Ship man
would have considered that Calhoun
had had Murgatroyd prepare
a splendid small sample of
antibody-containing serum, in
case something got out of hand.
It would assuredly take care of
two patients.</p>

<p>But a Med Ship man would also
have known that it was simply
one of those scrupulous precautions
a Med Ship man takes
when using cultures from store.</p>

<p>Calhoun put the sample away
and called Maril back and offered
no explanation. She said;</p>

<p>"I'll fix lunch." She hesitated.
"You brought some food from the
first Weald ship. Do you want
it?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'm squeamish," he admitted.
"The trouble on Dara is Med
Service fault. Before my time,
but still&mdash;I'll stick to rations until
everybody eats."</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>He watched her unobtrusively
as the day went on. Presently
he considered that she was
slightly flushed. Shortly after the
evening meal of singularly unappetizing
Darian rations, she
drank thirstily. He did not comment.
He brought out cards and
showed her a complicated game
of solitaire in which mental arithmetic
and expert use of probability
increased one's chance of winning.</p>

<p>By midnight, ship-time, she'd
learned the game and played it
absorbedly. Calhoun was able to
scrutinize her without appearing
to do so, and he was satisfied
again. When he mentioned that
the Med Ship should arrive off
Dara in eight hours more, she
put the cards away and went into
the other cabin.</p>

<p>Calhoun wrote up the log. He
added the notes that Maril had
made for him, of Murgatroyd's
pulse and blood-pressure after
the injection of the same culture
that produced fever and thirstiness
in himself and later&mdash;without
contact with him or the culture&mdash;in
Maril. He put a professional
comment at the end.</p>

<p>"The culture seems to have retained
its normal characteristics
during long storage in the spore
state. It revived and reproduced
rapidly. I injected .5 cc under
my skin and in less than one
hour my temperature was 30.8¬∞C.
An hour later it was 30.9¬∞C.
This was its peak. It immediately
returned to normal. The only
other observable symptom was
slightly increased thirst. Blood-pressure
and pulse remained normal.
The other person in the Med
Ship displayed the same symp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>toms,
in prompt and complete
repetition, without physical contact."</p>

<p>He went to sleep, with Murgatroyd
curled up in his cubbyhole.</p>

<p>The Med Ship broke out of
overdrive at 1300 hours, ship
time. Calhoun made contact with
the grid and was promptly lowered
to the ground.</p>

<p>It was almost two hours later&mdash;1500
hours ship-time&mdash;when
the people of Dara were informed
by broadcast that Calhoun was
publicly to be executed; immediately.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">CHAPTER 7</h2>


<p>From the viewpoint of Darians,
the decision of Calhoun's
guilt and the decision to execute
him were reasonable enough.
Maril protested fiercely, and her
testimony agreed with Calhoun's
in every respect, but from a
blueskin viewpoint their own
statements were damning.</p>

<p>Calhoun had taken four young
astrogators to space. They were
the only semi-skilled space-pilots
Dara had. There were no fully
qualified men. Calhoun had asked
for them, and taken them out to
emptiness, and there he had instructed
them in modern guidance-methods
for ships of space.
So far there was no disagreement.
He'd proposed to make
them more competent pilots;
more capable of driving a ship
to Orede, for example, to raid the
enormous cattle-herds there. And
he'd had them drive the Med
Ship to Weald, against which
there could be no objection.</p>

<p>But just before arrival he had
tricked all four of them by giving
them drugged coffee. He'd destroyed
the lethal bacterial cultures
they'd been ordered to dump
on Weald. Then he'd sent the four
student pilots off separately&mdash;so
he and Maril claimed&mdash;in huge
ships crammed with grain. But
those ships were not to be believed
in, anyhow. Nobody on
Dara could imagine stores of food
bought up and stored away because
it was useless; to keep up
prices. Nobody believed in shiploads
of grain to be had for the
taking. They did know that the
only four partially experienced
space-pilots on Dara had been
taken away and by Calhoun's
own story sent out of the ship
after they'd been drugged. Had
they been trained, and had they
been helped or even permitted to
sow the seeds of plague on
Weald, and had they come back
prepared to pass on training to
other men to handle other space-ships
now feverishly being built
in hidden places on Dara,&mdash;why&mdash;then
Dara might have a chance
of survival. But a space-battle
with only partly trained pilots
would be hazardous at best. With
no trained pilots at all, it would
be hopeless. So Calhoun, by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
own story, appeared to have
doomed every living being on
Dara to massacre from the bombs
of Weald.</p>

<p>It was this last angle which destroyed
any chance of anybody
believing in such fairy-tale objects
as ships loaded down with
grain. Calhoun had shattered
Dara's feeble hope of resistance.
Weald had some ships and could
build or buy others faster than
Dara could hope to construct
them. Equally important, Weald
had a plenitude of experienced
spacemen to man some ships fully
and train the crews of others.
If it had become desperately busy
fighting plague, then a fleet to
exterminate life on Dara would
be delayed. Dara might have
gained time at least to build
ships which could ram their enemies
and destroy them that way.</p>

<p>But Calhoun had made it impossible.
If he told the truth and
Weald already had a fleet of huge
ships which only needed to be
emptied of grain and filled with
guns and men&mdash;why&mdash;Dara was
doomed. But if he did not tell the
truth it was equally doomed by
his actions. So Calhoun would be
killed.</p>

<p>His execution was to take place
in the open space of the landing-grid,
with vision-cameras transmitting
the sight over all the
blueskin planet. Half-starved
men, with grisly blue blotches on
their skins, marched him to the
center of the largest level space
on the planet which was not desperately
being cultivated. Their
hatred showed in their expressions.
Bitterness and fury surrounded
Calhoun like a wall.
Most of Dara would have liked
to see him killed in a manner as
atrocious as his crime, but no
conceivable death would be satisfying.</p>

<p>So the affair was coldly businesslike,
with not even insults offered
to him. He was left to stand
alone in the very center of the
landing-grid floor. There were a
hundred blasters which would fire
upon him at the same instant. He
would not only be killed; he
would be destroyed. He would
be vaporized by the blue-white
flames poured upon him.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>His death was remarkably
close. Nothing remained but
the order to fire, when loudspeakers
from the landing-grid office
froze everything. One of the
grain-ships from Weald had broken
out of overdrive and its pilot
was triumphantly calling for
landing-co√∂rdinates. The grid office
relayed his call to loudspeaker
circuits as the quickest way to
get it on the communication system
of the whole planet.</p>

<p>"<i>Calling ground</i>," boomed the
triumphant voice of the first of
the student pilots Calhoun had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
trained. "<i>Calling ground! Pilot
Franz in captured ship requests
co√∂rdinates for landing! Purpose
of landing, to deliver half
a million bushels of grain captured
from the enemy!</i>"</p>

<p>At first, nobody dared believe
it. But the pilot could be seen on
vision. He was known. No blueskin
would be left alive long
enough to be used as a decoy by
the men of Weald! Presently the
giant ship on its second voyage
to Dara&mdash;the first had been a
generation ago, when it threatened
death and destruction&mdash;appeared
as a dark pinpoint in
the sky. It came down and down,
and presently it hovered over the
center of the tarmac, where Calhoun
composedly stood on the
spot where he was to have been
executed.</p>

<p>The landing-grid crew shifted
the ship to one side, and only then
did Calhoun stroll in a leisurely
fashion toward the Med Ship
by the grid's metal-lace wall.</p>

<p>The big ship touched ground,
and its exit-port revolved and
opened, and the student pilot
stood there grinning and heaving
out handsful of grain. There was
a swarming, yelling, deliriously
triumphant crowd, then, where
only minutes before there'd been
a mob waiting to rejoice when
Calhoun's living body exploded
into flame.</p>

<p>They no longer hated Calhoun,
but he had to fight his way to the
Med Ship, nevertheless. He
was surrounded by now-ecstatically
admiring citizens of Dara,
only minutes since they'd thirsted
for his blood.</p>

<p>Two hours after the first ship,
a second landed. Dara went wild
again. Four hours later still, the
third arrived. The fourth came
down on the following day.</p>

<p>Then Calhoun faced the executive
and cabinet of Dara for the
second time. His tone and manner
were very dry.</p>

<p>"Now," he said curtly, "I
would like a few more astrogators
to train. I think it likely that we
can raid the Wealdian grain-fleet
one time more, and in so doing
get the beginning of a fleet for
defense. I insist, however, that
it must not be used in combat!
We might as well be sensible
about this situation! After all,
four shiploads of grain won't
break the famine! They'll help a
lot, but they're only the beginning
of what's needed for a planetary population!"</p>

<p>"How much grain can we hope
for?" demanded a man with a
blue mark covering all his chin.</p>

<p>Calhoun told him.</p>

<p>"How long before Weald can
have a fleet overhead, dropping
fusion bombs?" demanded another,
grimly.</p>

<p>Calhoun named a time. But
then he said;</p>

<p>"I think we can keep them
from dropping bombs if we can
get the grain-fleet and some capable
astrogators."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you have in mind?"</p>

<p>He told them. It was not possible
to tell the whole story of
what he considered sensible behavior.
An emotional program
can be presented and accepted
immediately. A plan of action
which is actually intelligent, considering
all elements of a situation,
has to be accepted piecemeal.
Even so, the military men
growled.</p>

<p>"We've plenty of heavy elements,"
said one, with one eye
and half his forehead colored
blue. "If we'd used our brains,
we'd have more bombs than
Weald can hope for! We could
turn that whole planet into a
smoking cinder!"</p>

<p>"Which," said Calhoun acidly,
"would give you some satisfaction
but not an ounce of food!
And food's more important than
satisfaction. Now, I'm going to
take off for Weald again. I'll
want somebody to build an emergency
device for my ship, and I'll
want the four pilots I've trained
and twenty more candidates. And
I'd like to have some decent rations!
When the last trip brought
back two million bushels of grain,
you can spare adequate food for
twenty men for a few days!"</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>It took some time to get the
special device constructed, but
the Med Ship lifted in two days
more. The device for which it
had waited was simply a preventive
of the disaster overtaking
the ship from the mine on Orede.
It was essentially a tank of liquid
oxygen, packed in the space
from which stores had been taken
away. When the ship's air-supply
was pumped past it, first
moisture and then CO2 froze out.
Then the air flowed over the liquefied
oxygen at a rate to replace
the CO2 with more useful breathing
material. Then the moisture
was restored to the air as it
warmed again. For so long as the
oxygen lasted, fresh air for any
number of men could be kept purified
and breathable. The Med
Ship's normal equipment could
take care of no more than ten.
But with this it could journey to
Weald with almost any complement
on board.</p>

<p>Maril stayed on Dara when the
Med Ship left. Murgatroyd protested
shrilly when he discovered
her about to be closed out by the
closing lock-door.</p>

<p>"<i>Chee!</i>" he said indignantly.
"<i>Chee! Chee!</i>"</p>

<p>"No," said Calhoun, "we'll be
crowded enough anyhow. We'll
see her later."</p>

<p>He nodded to one of the first
four student pilots, and he crisply
made contact with the landing-grid
office. He very efficiently
supervised as the grid took the
ship up. The other three of the
four first-trained men explained
every move to sub-classes assigned
to each. Calhoun moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
about, listening and making certain
that the instruction was up
to standard.</p>

<p>He felt queer, acting as the
supervisor of an educational institution
in space. He did not
like it. There were twenty-four
men beside himself crowded
into the Med Ship's small interior.
They got in each other's
way. They trampled on each
other. There was always somebody
eating, and always somebody
sleeping, and there was no
need whatever for the background
tape to keep the ship
from being intolerably quiet. But
the air-system worked well
enough, except once when the reheater
unit quit and the air inside
the ship went down below
freezing before the trouble could
be found and corrected.</p>

<p>The journey to Weald, this
time, took seven days because of
the training program in effect.
Calhoun bit his nails over the
delay. But it was necessary for
each of the students to make
his own line-ups on Weald's sun,
and compute distances, and for
each of them to practise maneuverings
that would presently be
called for. Calhoun hoped desperately
that preparations for active
warfare&mdash;or massacre&mdash;did not
move fast on Weald. He believed,
however, that in the absence of
direct news from Dara, Wealdian
officials would take the normal
course of politicos. They had proclaimed
the deathship from Orede
an attack from Dara. Therefore
they would specialize on defensive
measures before plumping
for offense. They'd get patrol-ships
out to spot invasion ships
long before they worked on a
fleet to destroy the blueskins. It
would meet the public demand
for defense.</p>

<p>Calhoun was right. The Med
Ship made its final approach to
Weald under Calhoun's own control.
He'd made brightness-measurements
on his previous journey
and he used them again.
They would not be strictly accurate,
because a sunspot could
knock all meaning out of any
reading beyond two decimal
places. But the first breakout
was just far enough from the
Wealdian system for Calhoun to
be able to pick out its planets
with electron telescope at maximum
magnification. He could
aim for Weald itself,&mdash;allowing,
of course, for the lag in the apparent
motion of its image because
of the limited speed of
light. He tried the briefest of
overdrive hops, and came out
within the solar system and well
inside any watching patrol.</p>

<p>That was pure fortune. It continued.
He'd broken through the
screen of guard-ships in undetectable
overdrive. He was within
half an hour's solar-system
drive of the grain-fleet. There
was no alarm, at first. Of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
radars spotted the Med Ship as
an object, but nobody paid attention.
It was not headed for Weald.
It was probably assumed to be a
guard-boat itself. Such mistakes
do happen. It reached the grain-fleet.</p>

<p>Again from the storage-space
from which supplies had been removed,
Calhoun produced vacuum
suits. The four first students
went out, each escorting a less-accustomed
neophyte and all
fastened firmly together with
space-ropes. They warmed the
interiors of four ships and went
on to others. Presently there
were eight ships making ready
for an interstellar journey, each
with a scared but resolute new
pilot familiarizing himself with
its controls. There were sixteen
ships. Twenty. Twenty-three.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>A guard-ship came humming
out from Weald. It
would be armed, of course. It
came droning, droning up the
forty-odd thousand miles from
the planet. Calhoun swore. He
could not call his students and
tell them what was happening.
The guard-ship would overhear.
He could not trust untried young
men to act rationally if they were
unwarned and the guard-ship arrived
and matter-of-factly attempted
to board one of them.</p>

<p>Then he was inspired. He
called Murgatroyd, placed him
before the communicator, and
set it at voice-only transmission.
This was familiar enough, to
Murgatroyd. He'd often seen Calhoun
use a communicator.</p>

<p>"<i>Chee!</i>" shrilled Murgatroyd.
"<i>Chee-chee!</i>"</p>

<p>A startled voice came out of
the speaker.</p>

<p>"<i>What's that?</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Chee</i>," said Murgatroyd zestfully.</p>

<p>The communicator was talking
to him. Murgatroyd adored three
things in order. One was Calhoun.
The second was coffee.
The third was pretending to
converse like a human being.
The speaker said explosively;</p>

<p>"<i>You there, identify yourself!</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Chee-chee-chee-chee!</i>" observed
Murgatroyd. He wriggled
with pleasure and added, reasonably
enough, "<i>Chee!</i>"</p>

<p>The communicator bawled;</p>

<p>"<i>Calling ground! Calling
ground! Listen to this! Something
that ain't human's talking
at me on a communicator! Listen
in an' tell me what to do!</i>"</p>

<p>Murgatroyd interposed with
another shrill;</p>

<p>"<i>Chee!</i>"</p>

<p>Then Calhoun pulled the Med
Ship slowly away from the
clump of still-lifeless grain-ships.
It was highly improbable
that the guard-boat would carry
an electron telescope. Most likely
it would have only an echo-radar,
and so could determ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>ine
only that an object of some
sort moved of its own accord in
space. Calhoun let the Med Ship
accelerate. That would be final
evidence. The grain-ships were
between Weald and its sun. Even
electron telescopes on the ground&mdash;and
electron-telescopes were
ultimately optical telescopes with
electronic amplification&mdash;even
electron telescopes on the ground
could not get a good image of the
ship through sunlit atmosphere.</p>

<p>"<i>Chee?</i>" asked Murgatroyd
solicitously. "<i>Chee-chee-chee?</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Is it blueskins?</i>" shakily demanded
the voice from the
guard-boat. "<i>Ground! Ground! Is
it blueskins?</i>"</p>

<p>A heavy, authoritative voice
came in with much greater volume.</p>

<p>"<i>That's no human voice</i>," it
said harshly. "<i>Approach its ship
and send back an image. Don't
fire first unless it heads for
ground.</i>"</p>

<p>The guard-ship swerved and
headed for the Med Ship. It was
still a very long way off.</p>

<p>"<i>Chee-chee</i>," said Murgatroyd
encouragingly.</p>

<p>Calhoun changed the Med
Ship's course. The guard-ship
changed course too. Calhoun let
it draw nearer,&mdash;but only a little.
He led it away from the fleet
of grain-ships.</p>

<p>He swung his electron telescope
on them. He saw a space-suited
figure outside one,&mdash;safely
roped, however. It was
easy to guess that someone had
meant to return to the Med
Ship for orders or to make a
report, and found the Med Ship
gone. He'd go back inside and
turn on a communicator.</p>

<p>"<i>Chee!</i>" said Murgatroyd.</p>

<p>The heavy voice boomed;</p>

<p>"<i>You there! This is a human-occupied
world! If you come in
peace, cut your drive and let our
guard-ship approach!</i>"</p>

<p>Murgatroyd replied in an interested
but doubtful tone. The
booming voice bellowed. Another
voice of higher authority took
over. Murgatroyd was entranced
that so many people wanted to
talk to him. He made what for
him was practically an oration.
The last voice spoke persuasively
and suavely.</p>

<p>"<i>Chee-chee-chee-chee</i>," said
Murgatroyd.</p>

<p>One of the grain-ships flickered
and ceased to be. It had gone
into overdrive. Another. And
another. Suddenly they began to
flick out of sight by twos and
threes.</p>

<p>"<i>Chee</i>," said Murgatroyd with
a note of finality.</p>

<p>The last grain-ship vanished.</p>

<p>"Calling guard-ship," said Calhoun
drily. "This is Med ship
Aesclipus Twenty. I called here a
couple of weeks ago. You've been
talking to my <i>tormal</i>, Murgatroyd."</p>

<p>A pause. A blank pause. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
profanity of deep and savage intemperance.</p>

<p>"I've been on Dara," said Calhoun.</p>

<p>Dead silence fell.</p>

<p>"There's a famine there," said
Calhoun deliberately. "So the
grain-ships you've had in orbit
have been taken away by men
from Dara&mdash;blueskins if you like&mdash;to
feed themselves and their
families. They've been dying of
hunger and they don't like it."</p>

<p>There was a single burst of
the unprintable. Then the formerly
suave voice said waspishly;</p>

<p>"<i>Well? The Med Service will
hear of your interference!</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Calhoun. "I'll report
it myself. I have a message
for you. Dara is ready to pay for
every ounce of grain and for the
ships it was stored in. They'll pay
in heavy metals,&mdash;iridium, uranium,&mdash;that sort of thing."</p>

<p>The suave voice fairly curdled.</p>

<p>"<i>As if we'd allow anything that
was ever on Dara to touch ground
here!</i>"</p>

<p>"Ah! But there can be sterilization.
To begin with metals,
uranium melts at 1150¬∞ centigrade,
and tungsten at 3370¬∞
and iridium at 2350¬∞. You could
load such things and melt them
down in space and then tow
them home. And you can actually
sterilize a lot of other useful materials!"</p>

<p>The suave voice said infuriatedly;</p>

<p>"<i>I'll report this! You'll suffer
for this!</i>"</p>

<p>Calhoun said pleasantly;</p>

<p>"I'm sure that what I say is
being recorded, so that I'll add
that it's perfectly practical for
Wealdians to land on Dara, take
whatever property they think
wise,&mdash;to pay for damage done
by blueskins, of course&mdash;and get
back to Wealdian ships with absolutely
no danger of carrying
contagion. If you'll make sure the
recording's clear."</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>He described, clearly and specifically,
exactly how a man
could be outfitted to walk into any
area of any conceivable contagion,
do whatever seemed necessary
in the way of looting&mdash;but
Calhoun did not use the word&mdash;and
then return to his fellows
with no risk whatever of bringing
back infection. He gave exact
details. Then he said;</p>

<p>"My radar says you've four
ships converging on me to blast
me out of space. I sign off."</p>

<p>The Med Ship disappeared
from normal space, and entered
that improbably stressed area of
extension which it formed about
itself and in which physical constants
were wildly strange. For
one thing, the speed of light in
overdrive-stressed space had
not been measured yet. It was too
high. For another, a ship could
travel very many times 186000
miles per second in overdrive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The Med Ship did just that.
There was nobody but Calhoun
and Murgatroyd on board.
There was companionable silence,&mdash;there
were only the small
threshold-of-perception sounds
which one did not often notice,
but which it would have been intolerable
to have stop.</p>

<p>Calhoun luxuriated in regained
privacy. For seven days he'd had
twenty-four other human beings
crowded into the two cabins of
the ship, with never so much as
one yard of space between himself
and someone else. One need
not be snobbish to wish to be
alone sometimes!</p>

<p>Murgatroyd licked his whiskers
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I hope," said Calhoun, "that
things work out right. But they
may remember on Dara that I'm
responsible for some ten million
bushels of grain reaching them.
Maybe&mdash;just possibly&mdash;they'll
listen to me and act sensibly. After
all, there's only one way to
break a famine. Not with ten
million bushels for a whole planet!
And certainly not with
bombs!"</p>

<p>Driving direct, without pausing
for practisings, the Med Ship
could arrive at Dara in little
more than five days. Calhoun
looked forward to relaxation. As
a beginning he made ready to
give himself an adequate meal
for the first time since first landing
on Dara. Then, presently, he
sat down wrily to a double meal
of Darian famine-rations, which
were far from appetizing. But
there wasn't anything else on
board.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>He had some pleasure later,
though, envisioning what
went elsewhere. On Weald, obviously,
there would be purest panic.
The vanishing of the grain
fleet wouldn't be charged against
twenty-four men. A Darian fleet
would be suspected, and with the
suspicion terror, and with terror
a governmental crisis. Then
there'd be a frantic seizure of
any craft that could take to space,
and the agitated improvisation
of a space-fleet.</p>

<p>But besides that, biological-warfare
technicians would examine
Calhoun's instructions for
equipment by which armed men
could be landed on a plague-stricken
planet and then safely
taken off again. Military and
governmental officials would come
to the eminently sane conclusion
that while Calhoun could
not well take active measures
against blueskins, as a sane and
proper citizen of the galaxy he
would be on the side of law and
order and propriety and justice,&mdash;in
short, of Weald. So they
ordered sample anti-contagion
suits made according to Calhoun's
directions, and they had
them tested. They worked admirably.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>On Dara, while Calhoun journeyed
back to it, grain was distributed
lavishly, and everybody
on the planet had their cereal ration
almost doubled. It was still
not a comfortable ration, but the
relief was great. There was considerable
gratitude felt for Calhoun,
which as usual included a
lively anticipation of further favors
to come. Maril was interviewed
repeatedly, as the person
best able to discuss him, and she
did his reputation no harm. That
was not all that happened on
Dara ...</p>

<p>There was something else. Very
curious thing, too. There was a
curious spread of mild symptoms
which nobody could exactly call
a disease. It lasted only a few
hours. A person felt slightly feverish,
and ran a temperature
which peaked at 30.9¬∞ centigrade,
and drank more water
than usual. Then his temperature
went back to normal and he forgot
all about it. There have always
been such trivial epidemics.
They are rarely recorded, because
few people think to go to a doctor.
That was the case here.</p>

<p>Calhoun looked ahead a little,
too. Presently the fleet of grain-ships
would arrive and unload
and lift again for Orede, and
this time they would make an infinity
of slaughter among wild
cattle-herds, and bring back incredible
quantities of fresh-slaughtered
frozen beef. Almost
everybody would get to taste
meat again, which would be most
gratifying.</p>

<p>Then, the industries of Dara
would labor at government-required
tasks. An astonishing
amount of fissionable material
would be fashioned into bombs&mdash;a
concession by Calhoun&mdash;and
plastic factories make an astonishing
number of plastic sag-suits.
And large shipments of
heavy metals in ingots would be
made to the planet's capital city
and there would be some guns
and minor items....</p>

<p>Perhaps somebody could have
found out any of these items in
advance, but it was unlikely that
anybody did. Nobody but Calhoun,
however, would ever have
put them together and hoped very
urgently that that was the way
things would work out. He could
see a promising total result. In
fact, in the Med ship hurtling
through space, on the fourth day
of his journey he thought of an
improvement that could be made
in the sum of all those happenings
when they were put together.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>He landed on Dara. Maril came
to the Med Ship. Murgatroyd
greeted her with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Something unusual has happened,"
said Maril, very much
subdued. "I told you that&mdash;sometimes
blueskin markings fade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
out on children, and then neither
they nor their children ever have
blueskin markings again."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Calhoun. "I remember."</p>

<p>"And you were reminded of a
group of viruses on Tralee. You
said they only took hold of people
in terribly bad physical condition,
but then they could be
passed on from mother to child.
Until&mdash;sometimes&mdash;they died
out."</p>

<p>Calhoun blinked.</p>

<p>"Yes...."</p>

<p>"Korvan," said Maril very carefully,
"Has worked out an idea
that that's what happens to the
blueskin markings on&mdash;us Darians.
He thinks that people almost
dead of the plague could get
the&mdash;virus, and if they recovered
from the plague pass the virus
on and&mdash;be blueskins."</p>

<p>"Interesting," said Calhoun,
noncommittally.</p>

<p>"And when we went to Weald,"
said Maril very carefully indeed,
"you were working with
some culture-material. You wrote
quite a lot about it in the ship's
log. You gave yourself an injection.
Remember? And Murgatroyd?
You wrote down your
temperature, and Murgatroyd's?"
She moistened her
lips. "You said that if infection
passed between us, something
would be very infectious indeed?"</p>

<p>"What are you driving at?"</p>

<p>Maril continued slowly. "Th&mdash;thousands
of people are having
their pigment-spots fade away.
Not only children but grownups.
And&mdash;Korvan has found out that
it always seems to happen after
a day when they felt feverish
and very thirsty&mdash;and then felt
all right again. You tried out
something that made you feverish
and thirsty. I had it too, in
the ship. Korvan thinks there's
been an epidemic of something
that&mdash;is obliterating the blue
spots on everybody that catches
it. There are always trivial epidemics
that nobody notices. Korvan's
found evidence of one that's
making 'blueskin' no longer a
word with any meaning."</p>

<p>"Remarkable!" said Calhoun.</p>

<p>"Did you&mdash;do it?" asked Maril.
"Did you start a harmless epidemic
that&mdash;wipes out the virus
that makes blueskins?"</p>

<p>Calhoun said in feigned astonishment;</p>

<p>"How can you think such a
thing, Maril?"</p>

<p>"Because I was there," said
Maril. She said somehow desperately;
"I know you did it! But
the question is&mdash;are you going
to tell? When people find they're
not blueskins any longer&mdash;when
there's no such thing as a blueskin
any longer&mdash;will you tell
them why?"</p>

<p>"Naturally not," said Calhoun.
"Why?" Then he guessed. "Has
Korvan&mdash;."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"He thinks," said Maril, "that
he thought it up all by himself.
He's found the proof. He's&mdash;very
proud. I'd have to tell him the
truth if you were going to tell.
And he'd be ashamed and&mdash;angry."</p>

<p>Calhoun considered, staring at
her.</p>

<p>"How it happened doesn't matter,"
he said at last. "The idea
of anybody doing it deliberately
would be disturbing, too. It
shouldn't get about. So it seems
much the best thing for Korvan
to discover what's happened to
the blueskin pigment, and how it
happened, but not why."</p>

<p>She read his face carefully.</p>

<p>"You aren't doing it as a favor
to me," she decided. "You'd
rather it was that way."</p>

<p>She looked at him for a long
time, until he squirmed. Then
she nodded and went away.</p>

<p>An hour later the Wealdian
space-fleet was reported, massed
in space and driving for Dara.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">CHAPTER 8</h2>


<p>There were small scout-ships
which came on ahead of
the main fleet. They'd originally
been guard-boats, intended for
solar-system duty only and quite
incapable of overdrive. They'd
come from Weald in the cargo-holds
of the liners now transformed
into fighting ships. The
scouts swept low, transmitting
fine-screen images back to the
fleet, of all that they might see
before they were shot down. They
found the landing-grid. It contained
nothing larger than Calhoun's
Med Ship, Aesclipus
Twenty.</p>

<p>They searched here and there.
They flitted to and fro, scanning
wide bands of the surface of
Dara. The planet's cities and
highways and industrial centers
were wholly open to inspection
from the sky. It looked as if the
scouts hunted most busily for
the fleet of former grain-ships
which Calhoun had said blueskins
had seized and rushed
away. If the scouts looked for
them, they did not find them.</p>

<p>Dara offered no opposition to
the scout-ships. Nothing rose to
space to oppose or to resist their
search. They went darting over
every portion of the hungry
planet, land and seas alike, and
there was no sign of military
preparedness against their coming.
The huge ships of the main
fleet waited while they reported
monotonously that they saw no
sign of the stolen fleet. But the
stolen fleet was the only means
by which the planet could be defended.
There could be no point
in a pitched battle in emptiness.
But a fleet with a planet to back
it might be dangerous.</p>

<p>Hours passed. The Wealdian
main fleet waited. There was no
offensive movement by the fleet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
There was no defensive action
from the ground, With fusion-bombs
certain to be involved in
any actual conflict, there was
something like an embarrassed
pause. The Wealdian ships were
ready to bomb. They were less
anxious to be vaporized by possible
suicide-dashes of defending
ships who might blow themselves
up near contact with their
enemies.</p>

<p>But a fleet cannot travel some
light-years through space to
make a mere threat. And the
Wealdian fleet was furnished
with the material for total devastation.
It could drop bombs
from hundreds, or thousands, or
even tens of thousands of miles
away. It could cover the world of
Dara with mushroom clouds
springing up and spreading to
make a continuous pall of atomic-fusion
products. And they could
settle down and kill every living
thing not destroyed by the explosions
themselves. Even the creatures
of the deepest oceans would
die of deadly, purposely-contrived
fallout particles.</p>

<p>The Wealdian fleet contemplated
its own destructiveness. It
found no capacity for defense on
Dara. It moved forward.</p>

<p>But then a message went out
from the capital city of Dara. It
said that a ship in overdrive had
carried word to a Darian fleet in
space. The Darian fleet now
hurtled toward Weald. It was a
fleet of thirty-seven giant ships.
They carried such-and-such
bombs in such-and-such quantities.
Unless its orders were countermanded,
it would deliver those
bombs on Weald&mdash;set to explode.
If Weald bombed Dara, the orders
could not be withdrawn. So
Weald could bomb Dara. It could
destroy all life on the pariah
planet. But Weald would die
with it.</p>

<p>The fleet ceased its advance.
The situation was a stalemate
with pure desperation on one
side and pure frustration on the
other. This was no way to end
the war. Neither planet could
trust the other, even for minutes.
If they did not destroy each
other simultaneously, as now
was possible, each would expect
the other to launch an unwarned
attack at some other moment.
Ultimately one or the other must
perish, and the survivor would
be the one most skilled in treachery.</p>

<p>But then the pariah planet
made a new proposal. It would
send a messenger-ship to stop its
own fleet's bombardment if
Weald would accept payment for
the grain-ships and their cargoes.
It would pay in ingots of iridium
and uranium and tungsten&mdash;and
gold if Weald wished it&mdash;for
all damages Weald might
claim. It would even pay indemnity
for the miners of Orede,
who had died by accident but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
perhaps in some sense through
its fault. It would pay.... But
if it were bombed, Weald must
spout atomic fire and the fleet of
Weald would have no home
planet to return to.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>This proposal seemed both
craven and foolish. It would
allow the fleet of Weald to loot
and then betray Dara. But it was
Calhoun's idea. It seemed plausible
to the admirals of Weald.
They felt only contempt for blueskins.
Contemptuously, they accepted
the semi-surrender.</p>

<p>The broadcast waves of Dara
told of agreement, and wild and
fierce resentment filled the pariah
planet's people. There was
almost&mdash;almost!&mdash;revolution to
insist upon resistance, however
hopeless and however fatal. But
not all of Dara realized that a
vital change had come about in
the state of things on Dara. The
enemy fleet had not a hint of it.
And therefore&mdash;</p>

<p>In menacing array, the invading
fleet spread itself about the
skies of Dara, well beyond the
atmosphere. Harsh voices talked
with increasing arrogance to the
landing-grid staff. A monster
ship of Weald came heavily
down, riding the landing-grid's
force-fields. It touched gently.
Its occupants were apprehensive,
but hungry for the loot they had
been assured was theirs. The
ship's outer hull would be sterilized
before it returned to Weald,
of course. And there was adequate
protection for the landing-party.</p>

<p>Men came out of the ship's
ports. They wore the double,
transparent sag-suits Calhoun
had suggested, which had been
painstakingly tested, and which
were perfect protection against
contagion. They could loot with
impunity, and all contamination
would remain outside the suits.
What loot they gathered, obviously,
could be decontaminated
before it was returned to Weald.
It was a most satisfactory discovery,
to realize that blueskins
could be not only scorned but
robbed. There was only one bit
of relevant information the
space-fleet of Weald did not have.</p>

<p>That information was that the
people of Dara weren't blueskins
any longer. There'd been a trivial
epidemic.</p>

<p>The sag-suited men of Weald
went zestfully about their business.
They took over the landing-grid's
operation, driving the
Darian operators away. For the
first time in history the operators
of a landing-grid wore
makeup to look like they did
have blue pigment in their skins.
The Wealdian landing-party tested
the grid's operation. They
brought down another giant
ship. Then another. And another.</p>

<p>Parties in the shiny sag-suits
spread through the city. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
were the huge stock-piles of precious
metals, brought in readiness
to be surrendered and carried away.
Some men set to work
to load these into the holds&mdash;to
be sterilized later. Some went
forthrightly after personal loot.</p>

<p>They came upon very few Darians.
Those they saw kept sullenly
away from them. They entered
shops and took what they
fancied. They zestfully removed
the treasure of banks.</p>

<p>Triumphal and scornful reports
went up to the hovering
great ships. The blueskins, said
the reports were spiritless and
cowardly. They permitted themselves
to be robbed. They kept
out of the way. It had been observed
that the population was
streaming out of the city, fleeing
because they feared the ships'
landing-parties. The blueskins
had abjectly produced all they'd
promised of precious metals, but
there was more to be taken.</p>

<p>More ships came down, and
more. Some of the first, heavily
loaded, were lifted to emptiness
again and the process of decontamination
of their hulls began.
There was jealousy among the
ships in space for those upon the
ground. The first-landed ships
had had their choice of loot.
There were squabblings about
priorities, now that the navy of
Weald plainly had a license to
steal. There was confusion
among the members of the landing-parties.
Discipline disappeared.
Men in plastic sag-suits
roved about as individuals, seeking
what they might loot.</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>There were armed and alerted
landing-parties around the
grid itself, of course, but the
capital city of Dara lay open.
Men coming back with loot
found their ships already lifted
off to make room for others.
They were pushed into re√´mbarking-parties
of other ships.
There were more and more men
to be found on ships where they
did not belong, and more and
more not to be found where they
did. By the time half the fleet
had been aground, there was no
longer any pretense of holding
a ship down until all its crew returned.
There were too many
other ships' companies clamoring
for their turn to loot. The rosters
of many ships, indeed, bore no
particular relationship to the
men actually on board.</p>

<p>There were less than fifteen
ships whose to-be-fumigated
holds were still empty, when the
watchful government of Dara
broadcast a new message to the
invaders. It requested that the
looting stop. No matter what
payment Weald claimed, it had
taken payment five times over.
Now was time to stop.</p>

<p>It was amusing. The space-admiral
of Weald ordered his
ships alerted for action. The mes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>sage-ship,
ordering the Darian
fleet away from Weald, had been
sent off long since. No other ship
could get away now! The Darians
could take their choice; accept
the consequences of surrender,
or the fleet would rise to
throw down bombs.</p>

<p>Calhoun was asking politely to
be taken to the Wealdian admiral
when the trouble began. It wasn't
on the ground, at all. Everything
was under splendid control
where a landing-force occupied
the grid and all the ground immediately
about it. The space
admiral had headquarters in the
landing-grid office. Reports came
in, orders were issued, admirably
crisp salutes were exchanged
among sag-suited men.... Everything
was in perfect shape
there.</p>

<p>But there was panic among
the ships in space. Communicators
gave off horrified, panic-stricken
yells. There were
screamings. Intelligible communications
ceased. Ships plunged
crazily this way and that. Some
vanished in overdrive. At least
one plunged at full power into a
Darian ocean.</p>

<p>The space-admiral found himself
in command of fifteen ships
only, out of all his former force.
The rest of the fleet went through
a period of hysterical madness.
In some ships it lasted for minutes
only. In others it went on
for half an hour or more. Then
they hung overhead, but did not
reply to calls.</p>

<p>Calhoun arrived at the space-port
with Murgatroyd riding on
his shoulder. A bewildered officer
in a sag-suit halted him.</p>

<p>"I've come," said Calhoun, "to
speak to the admiral. My name
is Calhoun and I'm Med Service,
and I think I met the Admiral at
a banquet a few weeks ago. He'll
remember me."</p>

<p>"You'll have to wait," protested
the officer. "There's some
trouble&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Calhoun. "I know
about it. I helped design it. I
want to explain it to the admiral.
He needs to know what's happened,
if he's to take appropriate
measures."</p>

<p>There were jitterings. Many
men in sag-suits had still no
idea that anything had gone
wrong. Some appeared, brightly
carrying loot. Some hung eagerly
around the airlocks of ships
on the grid tarmac, waiting their
turns to stand in corrosive gases
for the decontamination of their
suits, when they would burn the
outer layers and step, aseptic
and happy, into a Wealdian ship
again. There they could think
how rich they were going to be
back on Weald.</p>

<p>But the situation aloft was bewildering
and very, very ominous.
There was strident argument.
Presently Calhoun stood
before the Wealdian admiral.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"I came to explain something,"
said Calhoun pleasantly. "The
situation has changed. You've
noticed it, I'm sure."</p>

<p>The admiral glared at him
through two layers of plastic,
which covered him almost like a
gift-wrapped parcel.</p>

<p>"Be quick!" he rasped.</p>

<p>"First," said Calhoun, "there
are no more blueskins. An epidemic
of something or other has
made the blue patches on the
skins of Darians fade out. There
have always been some who didn't
have blue patches. Now nobody has them."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" rasped the admiral.
"And what has that got to
do with this situation?"</p>

<p>"Why, everything," said Calhoun
mildly. "It means that Darians
can pass for Wealdians
whenever they please. That they
are passing for Wealdians. That
they've been mixing with your
men, wearing sag-suits exactly
like the one you're wearing now.
They've been going aboard your
ships in the confusion of returning
looters. There's not a ship
now aloft, that has been aground
today, that hasn't from one to
fifteen Darians&mdash;no longer blueskins&mdash;on
board."</p>

<p>The admiral roared. Then his
face turned gray.</p>

<p>"You can't take your fleet back
to Weald," said Calhoun gently,
"if you believe its crews have
been exposed to carriers of the
Dara plague. You wouldn't be allowed
to land, anyhow."</p>

<p>The admiral said through stiff
lips;</p>

<p>"I'll blast&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," said Calhoun, again
gently. "When you ordered all
ships alerted for action, the Darians
on each ship released panic-gas.
They only needed tiny,
pocket-sized containers of the
gas for the job. They had them.
They only needed to use air-tanks
from their sag-suits to protect
themselves against the gas. They
kept them handy. On nearly all
your ships aloft your crews are
crazy from panic-gas. They'll
stay that way until the air is
changed. Darians have barricaded
themselves in the control-rooms
of most if not all your
ships. You haven't got a fleet. If
the few ships that will obey your
orders, drop one bomb, our fleet
off Weald will drop fifty. I don't
think you'd better order offensive
action. Instead, I think
you'd better have your fleet medical
officers come and learn some
of the facts of life. There's no
need for war between Dara and
Weald, but if you insist...."</p>

<p>The Admiral made a choking
noise. He could have ordered
Calhoun killed, but there was a
certain appalling fact. The men
aground from the fleet were
breathing Wealdian air from
tanks. It would last so long only.
If they were taken on board the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
still obedient ships overhead,
Darians would unquestionably
be mixed with them. There was
no way to take off the parties
now aground without exposing
them to contact with Darians,
on the ground or in the ships.
There was no way to sort out the
Darians.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I will give the orders,"
said the admiral thickly. "I&mdash;do
not know what you devils plan,
but&mdash;I don't know how to stop
you."</p>

<p>"All that's necessary," said
Calhoun warmly, "is an open
mind. There's a misunderstanding
to be cleared up, and some
principles of planetary health
practises to be explained, and a
certain amount of prejudice that
has to be thrown away. But nobody
need die of changing their
minds. The Interstellar Medical
service has proved that over and
over!"</p>

<p>Murgatroyd, perched on his
shoulder, felt that it was time to
take part in the conversation. He
said;</p>

<p>"<i>Chee-chee!</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Calhoun. "We
do want to get the job done.
We're behind schedule now."</p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>It was not, of course, possible
for Calhoun to leave immediately.
He had to preside at various
meetings of the medical officers
of the fleet with the health
officials of Dara. He had to make
explanations, and correct misapprehensions,
and delicately suggest
such biological experiments
as would prove to the doctors of
Weald that there was no longer
a plague on Dara, whatever had
been the case three generations
before. He had to sit by while an
extremely self-confident young
Darian doctor named Korvan
rather condescendingly demonstrated
that the former blue pigmentation
was a viral product
quite unconnected with the
plague, and that it had been
wiped out by a very trivial epidemic
of&mdash;such and such. Calhoun
regarded that young man
with a detached interest. Maril
thought him wonderful, even if
she had to give him the material
for his work. Calhoun shrugged
and went on with his work:</p>

<p>The return of loot. Mutual,
full, and complete agreement
that Darians were no longer carriers
of plague, if they had ever
been. Unless Weald convinced
other worlds of this, Weald itself
would join Dara in isolation
from neighboring worlds. A messenger
ship to recall the twenty-seven
ships once floating in orbit
about Weald. Most of them
would be used for some time,
now, to bring beef from Orede.
Some would haul more grain
from Weald. It would be paid for.
There would be a need for commercial
missions to be exchanged
between Weald and Dara.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a full week before he
could go to the little Med Ship
and prepare for departure. Even
then there were matters to be
attended to. All the food-supplies
that had been removed could not
be replaced. There were biological
samples to be replaced and
some to be destroyed.... The
air-tanks....</p>

<p>Maril came to the Med Ship
again when he was almost ready
to leave. She did not seem comfortable.</p>

<p>"I wish you could like Korvan,"
she said regretfully.</p>

<p>"I don't dislike him," said Calhoun.
"I think he will be a most
prominent citizen, in time. He
has all the talents for it."</p>

<p>Maril smiled very faintly.</p>

<p>"But you don't admire him."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say that," protested
Calhoun. "After all, he is
attractive to you, which is something
I couldn't manage."</p>

<p>"You didn't try," said Maril.
"Just as I didn't try to be fascinating
to you. Why?"</p>

<p>Calhoun spread out his hands.
But he looked at Maril with respect.
Not every woman could
have faced the fact that a man
did not feel impelled to make
passes at her. It is simply a fact
that has nothing to do with desirability
or charm or anything
else.</p>

<p>"You're going to marry him,"
he said. "I hope you'll be very
happy."</p>

<p>"He's the man I want," said
Maril frankly. "He looks forward
to splendid discoveries. I'm sorry
it's so important to him."</p>

<p>Calhoun did not ask the obvious
question. Instead, he said
thoughtfully;</p>

<p>"There's something you could
do.... It needs to be done. The
Med Service in this sector has
been badly handled. There are a
number of&mdash;discoveries that
need to be made. I don't think
your Korvan would relish having
things handed to him on a visible
silver platter. But they should be
known...."</p>

<p>Maril said wrily;</p>

<p>"I can guess what you mean.
I never went into detail about
how the blueskin markings disappeared,
but a few hints&mdash;You've
got books for me?"</p>

<p>Calhoun nodded. He brought
them to her.</p>

<p>"If we only fell in love with
each other, Maril, we'd be a
team! Too bad! These are a wedding
present you'll do well to
hide."</p>

<p>She put her hands in his.</p>

<p>"I like you&mdash;almost as much
as I like Murgatroyd! Yes! Korvan
will never know, and he'll be
a great man." Then she added
defensively, "And not just from
these books! He'll make his own
wonderful discoveries."</p>

<p>"Of which," said Calhoun,
"the most remarkable is you.
Good luck Maril!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<hr class="invisible" />

<p>Presently the Med Ship
lifted. Calhoun aimed it for
the next planet on the list of
those he was to visit. After this
one more he'd return to sector
headquarters with a biting report
to make on the way things
had been handled before him. He
said;</p>

<p>"Overdrive coming, Murgatroyd!"</p>

<p>Then the stars went out and
there was silence, and privacy,
and a faint, faint, almost unhearable
series of background
sounds which kept the Med Ship
from being totally unendurable.</p>

<p>Long, long days later the ship
broke out of overdrive and Calhoun
guided it to a round and
sunlit world. In due time he
thumped the communicator-button.</p>

<p>"Calling ground," he said
crisply. "Calling ground! Med
Ship Aesclipus Twenty reporting
arrival and asking co√∂rdinates
for landing. Purpose of landing,
planetary health inspection. Our
mass is fifty standard tons."</p>

<p>There was a pause while the
beamed message went many,
many thousands of miles. Then
the speaker said;</p>

<p>"<i>Aesclipus Twenty, repeat
your identification!</i>"</p>

<p>Murgatroyd said;</p>

<p>"<i>Chee-chee? Chee?</i>"</p>

<p>Calhoun sighed.</p>

<p>"That's right, Murgatroyd!
Here we go again!"</p>
